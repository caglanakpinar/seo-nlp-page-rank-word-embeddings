"Montell Du’Sean Jordan (born December 3, 1968 in Los Angeles, California) is an American R&B singer, songwriter, and record producer. Jordan was the first R&B artist signed to the Def Jam label, and became the main male artist on its Def Soul imprint until leaving the label in 2003.      Jordan attended Pepperdine University in California to pick up a bachelor’s degree in communications, graduating summa cum laude and was a state finalist for the Rhodes Scholarship.      Jordan’s first single was the 1995 #1 hit single “This Is How We Do It”, and defined his hip hop soul musical style. “This Is How We Do It” and its follow- up, “Somethin’ 4 Da Honeyz”, show a strong hip hop influence, and Jordan’s material fit alongside the rest of Def Jam’s output. Future hits would include “Let’s Ride” with Master P in 1998 and “Get It on Tonite” in late-1999.      Besides crafting his own material, Jordan has written and produced for a number of outside artists, including Christina Milian, 98 Degrees, Deborah Cox (“Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here”, 1998), and Sisqó (the number-one hit “Incomplete”, 2000). The singer has had cameo roles in the films “The Fighting Temptations” and “The Nutty Professor.”      Jordan left Def Soul in 2003 and released the album “Life After Def” on Koch Records.      Jordan released his 7th project - “Let It Rain” - on October 21, 2008.      In 2010, Jordan left the music business to become a minister. As he explained on his Twitter feed, the decision is “a calling that’s probably been with me all my life since I was a child. And I’ve known it. A lot of people in the business know it and have the same calling but that leap of faith is difficult.”       ",391034,soul,"['hip hop', 'hip pop', 'new jack swing', 'r&b', 'urban contemporary']",montell jordan,61,"['This Is How We Do It', 'Get It On Tonite', 'This Is How We Do It', 'This Is How We Do It', 'This Is How We Do It', ""What's On Tonight"", ""Let's Ride"", 'Get It On Tonite', ""Let's Ride"", 'The Party (This Is How We Do It)']"
"**Bryan Adams** OC, OBC, (born 5 November 1959) is a Canadian rock singer, guitarist, songwriter and photographer. Some of his best-known albums are Reckless, 18 til I Die, and Waking Up the Neighbours.      Bryan Adams was already popular in [Canada](http://www.last.fm/place/Canada) when the release of his third album ‘Cuts Like A Knife’ in 1983 brought him a large following in the USA. His fourth album, ‘Reckless’, often referred to as one of the most significant of the 1980s, sold over 4 million copies at the time and continues to sell now. His fifth album ‘Into the Fire’ went platinum.      ‘Waking Up The Neighbours’, his sixth album in 1991, powered him to international stardom. The single ‘(Everything I Do) I Do For You’ spent 16 weeks at number 1; it broke a UK record that had stood since 1955 and still stands today. Across in the USA it became the second largest selling single to ‘We Are The World’. The song was featured in the film ‘Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves’ (1991) and for this Mr Adams received his first Academy Award nomination. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe.      42 film Directors’ have used Adams’ music as soundtrack - from A Night In Heaven (1983) to Bobby (2007).      Adams was awarded the C.M.

Adams has been nominated for three Academy Awards for songwriting, and was recently nominated for his fifth Golden Globe (2007) for his songwriting in the film ‘Bobby’.

"Joey Beltram (born 6 November 1971) is an American DJ and record producer, known best for the pioneering techno music recordings “Energy Flash” and “Mentasm”.      Though he has never belonged to any particular urban scene, he has nevertheless fascinated his audience through his musical independence. Nor can he as a “non-Manhattaner”, be counted as part of the New York scene: ”…with my productions I have to have my own sound”. His tracks present what he sees, whatever is running through his mind at the time or things he has lived through and experienced in all the years as a musician and DJ: the ups and the downs, the violence and confusion and of course, the feeling. His music carries many subtle undertones…      Joey Beltram grew up in Queens, New York, the son of a Mexican father and an Italian mother. In his tough surroundings, he stood his own ground and won the necessary respect on the street with his graffiti art. As a ‘subway surfer’ he belonged to a generation of kids whose images in the New York subways show obvious traces of their “feeling for survival and life”. “Poes” is his pseudonym, which still can be found, once in a while, as the signature under some of the big, colorful graffiti works. That urge is still there, but now he uses a different outlet for his creative energies: music. Back in 1983, at the age of twelve, he stood behind a turntable for the first time, and by 17 he had recorded his first maxi single — for Nu Groove in New York. Then followed a series of releases for Atmosphere Records and Easy Street, NY - and Trax Records in Chicago, under the project name Cold Six (“Forgotten Moments” - 1989). This “first official EP”, as he calls it, established contact for him with the Belgian label R&S Records, which ended up signing him to a recording contract.      At the end of 1989 Beltram went to Gent, Belgium as the first American musician to work there for a longer period. The result of his cooperation with Mundo Music as Second Phase was “Vortex” and “Mentasm”. “Let It Ride”, released under the project name Direct, opened his way into the US, “with a little detour through Europe”. But his worldwide breakthrough came with the release of “Energy Flash” in 1990. This Techno classic also succeeded in getting the new club generation onto dance floors in no time at all, again and again. By now a 20-year-old, the album “Beltram Vol. 1” (1991) helped to push the Techno revolution forward, and eliminated any of the early doubts that perhaps he was only a short-lived, one-hit phenomenon. At the end of 1990 musical differences between himself and label boss Renaat resulted in a mutually agreed separation between Beltram and R&S Records. Joey then concentrated on his career as a DJ, toured all over Europe and America, and continued working in his studio, even though he allowed himself a two-year break from any new releases.      In 1992, Beltram made his comeback on Warp Records with the EP “Calibre”",15342,classic,"['acid house', 'chicago house', 'hardcore techno', 'minimal techno', 'techno']",joey beltram,35,"['Energy Flash', 'Drome', 'Give Me Something - Joey Beltram Remix', 'Slice - Joseph Capriati Remix', 'Mentasm', 'Slice 2010 (Carl Cox Rerub)', 'Jazz 303', 'Breaking Bricks - Joey Beltram Remix', 'The Zound (Energy Flash)', 'My Sound']"
"**Wanda Jackson** (born Wanda Lavonne Jackson, October 20, 1937 in Maud, Oklahoma) is an American [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) singer. Having made her debut recordings at the age of nineteen, she became one of the first popular female rock and roll singers in history and as a result, a pioneering and influential figure in female musicianship. She is known as the “Queen (or First Lady) of Rockabilly.”      Jackson was still in high school when country singer Hank Thompson heard her sing on an Oklahoma City radio show and asked her to record with his band in 1954. She dated Elvis Presley, who encouraged her to step away from the country-tinged gospel she had been performing since childhood and try her hand at rock and roll. She developed her own distinctive voice and performed in a variety of styles, from folksy traditional tunes to country twang and high yodels to throaty, suggestive ballads. She was a prolific singer of songs with wry lyrics such as “Fujiyama Mama,” which contained many references to the World War II bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; ironically, it became a #1 hit in Japan. Her biggest hit was 1959’s “Let’s Have a Party.”      Jackson achieved great and continuing success throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia, but has never found the same level of fame in her native United States. She toured with rock and roll pioneers such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly. She has been nominated for two Grammys, and has been awarded the Oklahoma Native Daughter Award. She has been inducted into the Oklahoma Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the International Hall of Fame, the International Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame, and the German Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 2009 was finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence.      A born-again Christian, Jackson and her husband/manager Wendell Goodman abandoned rock and roll in 1971 and spent the next 25 years performing gospel in churches.      In 1996, Jackson was invited by alt-country singer Rosie Flores to duet with her on an upcoming album. The two were so pleased with the results that Jackson joined Flores on a handful of promotional club dates which were soon extended into a five-week North American tour. Jackson, plesantly surprised to discover that she and her songs were known by a generation of rockabilly fans her grandchildren’s age, soon assembled her own band and returned to clubs and festivals, where she continues to perform.      In recent years Jackson has recorded with such artists as The Cramps, Lee Rocker, Dave Alvin, and Elvis Costello. 2006 saw the release of a new Jackson album, I Remember Elvis.      In 2009, it was announced that Jackson would start work on new recordings with Jack White. The resulting album, The Party Ain’t Over, was released on January 25, 2011",65552,country,"['rock-and-roll', 'rockabilly', 'surf music']",wanda jackson,48,"[""Let's Have A Party"", 'Funnel of Love', 'Right Or Wrong', 'Right Or Wrong', 'Long Tall Sally', 'Hard Headed Woman', 'Fujiyama Mama - Remastered', 'Thunder on the Mountain', 'Stupid Cupid', 'Fujiyama Mama - Remastered']"
"**Mudvayne** is an American [metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal) band from Peoria, IL. The musical styles of their first two albums were highly innovative, combining elements of [progressive metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20metal) with [alternative metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20metal) and were considered to be a [math metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/math%20metal) band for this sound, although the band’s later albums changed direction. The band is best recognizable by their strong drumming, complex bass playing, heavy, gruff and usually angered vocals, heavy guitars and riffs, complex time signatures and frequent rhythm changes. Mudvayne sold over 6,000,000 copies worldwide.      Mudvayne’s first album, [L.D. 50](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/L.D.+50), was released in 2000. It received very positive critical acclaim, being most praised for its technical sound, which were uncommon for the rest of the bands in the early 2000s metal scene. The album was #1 at _Top Heatseekers_, and sold over 500,000 copies in its first four months after release (thus certified Gold by the RIAA). “[Dig](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Dig)”, the album’s lead single has won first ever MTV2 Video Music Award. Besides “Dig”, the album’s two other and also highly successive singles, “[Death Blooms](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Death+Blooms)” and “[Nothing to Gein](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Nothing+to+Gein)” paved the way for the album. At that time, the band was recognizable for their somewhat bizarre image. In 2001, the band released a live DVD entitled “(L)ive (D)osage 50”, that was recorded in 2001 in their home town of Peoria. The DVD was also certified Gold by the RIAA, selling over 500,000 copies.      Mudvayne’s sophomore release, [The End of All Things to Come](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/The+End+of+All+Things+to+Come), proved that the band was more than capable of progressing from a highly praised record successfully. The band took a totally different approach to songwriting. The album sounded more compact, with even more progressive elements. This album also received a great echo in the public, and was also certified Gold by the RIAA. The band’s lead single, “[Not Falling](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/Not+Falling)”, became an iconic song for the band. On this album, the band changed their image from multicolored face paint to dressing up as aliens, as seen on the video of “Not Falling” and several early shows in 2002. In 2003, with the release of another successful single, [World So Cold](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne/_/World+So+Cold), the band abandoned their use of make up. This was the first video that shows band members without any makeup. Shortly after, the band released another live DVD that was recorded on Summer Sanitarium Tour with Metallica and Linkin Park, entitled “All Access to All Things”.

"**Willie Hugh Nelson** (born April 30, 1933) is an [American](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20states) [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) singer, author, [poet](http://www.last.fm/tag/poet), actor and activist, originally from Abbott, Texas. He reached his greatest fame during the [outlaw country](http://www.last.fm/tag/outlaw%20country) movement of the 19[70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s), but remains iconic, especially in American popular culture.      Nelson was born and raised in Abbott, Texas, the son of Myrle and Ira D. Nelson, who was a mechanic and pool hall owner. His grandparents William Alfred Nelson and Nancy Elizabeth Smothers gave him mail-order music lessons starting at age six. He wrote his first song when he was seven and was playing in a local band at age nine. Willie played the guitar, while his sister Bobbie played the piano. He met Bud Fletcher, a fiddler, and, while he was still in high school, formed a band, the Bohemian Fiddlers, that included two of his siblings.      Nelson took part in the National FFA Organization (formerly known as the Future Farmers of America) while in high school.      Beginning in high school Nelson worked as a disc jockey for local radio stations. Nelson had short DJ stints with KHBR in Hillsboro, Texas, and later with KBOP in Pleasanton, Texas, as well as singing gigs in [honky tonk](http://www.last.fm/tag/honky%20tonk) bars.      Nelson graduated from Abbott High School in 1951. He joined the Air Force the same year but was discharged after nine months due to back problems. He then studied agriculture at Baylor University for one year in 1954.      In 1956, Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, to begin a musical career, recording “[Lumberjack](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson/_/Lumberjack),” which was written by [Leon Payne](http://www.last.fm/music/Leon+Payne). The single sold fairly well, but did not establish a career. Nelson continued to work as a radio announcer in Vancouver and to sing in clubs. He sold a song called “[Family Bible](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson/_/Family+Bible)” for $50; the song was a hit for [Claude Gray](http://www.last.fm/music/Claude+Gray) in 1960, has been covered widely and is often considered a [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) music classic.      Nelson moved to Nashville in 1960, but was unable to land a record label contract. He did, however, receive a publishing contract at Pamper Music. After [Ray Price](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Price) recorded Nelson’s “[Night Life](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson/_/Night+Life)” (reputedly the most covered country song of all time; a version of “Night Life” was even recorded by convicted killer and former cult leader [Charles Manson](http://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Manson)), Nelson joined Price’s touring band as a bass player. While playing with Ray Price and the Cherokee Cowboys, many of Nelson’s songs became hits for some of country and [pop](http://www.last",1119702,classic,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road']",willie nelson,71,"['Beer For My Horses', ""Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys"", 'On the Road Again - Live', 'Have You Ever Seen the Rain (feat.

"We don‘t know exactly when they called themselves Märtini Brös for the first time, but it should have been at one of their first joint clubgigs in Berlin, while one or the other was spinning records and one or the other was improvising on the guitar, the keyboard or on the mic.   But at the latest in summer 98 and the start of the Sundays-event series „Audiopark“ in the garden of Berlin‘s Suicide Club Clé and Mike Vamp present themselves as a duo as Märtini Brös.   Sine then they are creating hymn-like Electro-House-tracks and they benefit from the huge musical fundus and their longtime experience as DJs. You can always hear in their music what fun they had producing it, especially when it‘s down to vocoder homages.   Accordingly they write lively, strong and individual songs; sometimes with a funky guitar and sometimes with an 80ies-Moroder-bass. What starts as a sparse rhythm- and vocal-sample-framework condenses by-and-by to that kind of music that hits the nerv of the time.   The first Märtini Brös 12“ Material Love E.P. has been released on Raw Elements in 1998 and their fourth release Saviours Of The Universe (PFR13) in 2000 already included their first hit. Flash became the anthem of a whole club generation. Further single releases on Turbo (Canada) and Poker Flat / Superstar underpinned their reputation as up-and-coming artist and led up to the first longplay release in summer 2002.   With their debut album Pläy (Poker Flat / Turbo / Superstar) under the pillow they now slept more often in hotels than at home. They visited the entire club-equator and showed the people out there what it means to fläsh and that they do so the entire weekend and consequently everybody wanted to Dance Like It Is OK. The video has even been nominated for the German Dance Awards.   More remix requests followed by Tiga, Ivan Smagghe, Mr. Brooks and Detroit Grand Pubahs, who carried the sound further around the globe. The Märtini Brös became internationally demanded artists.   Since their first official liveshow at the world premiere of the german cultmovie Run Lola Run where they delivered a remarkable performance the Märtini Brös toured a couple of times around the globe. On their album world tour in 2002 and 2003 alone they played all over Europe, Australia, Canada and the US.   In between the gigs they remixed acts like Turner, Tok Tok, Tocotronic, Scissor Sisters, Louie Austen and 2Raumwohnung and Mike Vamp became part of the Remington Allstars side-projects for danceable electronica amongst the brothers Teichmann and others.   In late 2003 the singles Hot (Poker Flat, pfr34) and Boy/Girl (Poker Flat / Superstar) marked the end of the Pläy era. The Märtini Brös returned into their Audiopark studio and locked themselves away until the new album was ready.

"U2 is rock band from Ireland which formed in 1976 in Dublin, Ireland. Since the band’s formation, they have consisted of [Bono](http://www.last.fm/music/Bono) (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), [The Edge](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Edge) (real name David Evans) (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), [Adam Clayton](http://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Clayton) (bass) and [Larry Mullen, Jr.](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Mullen,+Jr.) (drums, percussion). The band is the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide as of 2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58 singles.      **Foundation:** The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge’s brother Dick Evans (later a member of [Virgin Prunes](http://www.last.fm/music/Virgin+Prunes)), Ivan McCormick and [Peter Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Martin). According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn’t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn’t sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names “Feedback ” and “The Hype” before finally settling on U2.      **The 70s & 80s:** 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: £500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band’s manager and U2 released an EP called [Three](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Three) and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, [Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Boy) and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: [October](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/October), [War](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/War), [Under A Blood Red Sky](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Under+A+Blood+Red+Sky), and [The Unforgettable Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Unforgettable+Fire) (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called “a different kind” of band.

The band’s original line-up changed several times before the release of the group’s debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band’s second album [Blue](http://www.last.fm/music/Third+Eye+Blind/Blue) — at which point the band’s main guitarist [Kevin Cadogan](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Cadogan) was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind’s current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Abe Millett (bass guitar), [Brad Hargreaves](http://www.last.fm/music/Brad+Hargreaves) (drums), and Kryz Reid (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-[Smash Mouth](http://www.last.fm/music/Smash+Mouth) drummer Michael Urbano and early [Primus](http://www.last.fm/music/Primus) drummer Tim ‘’Curveball’’ Wright.      Third Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for [Oasis](http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis), prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing [Liam Gallagher](http://www.last.fm/music/Liam+Gallagher) to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins’ outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of “the biggest mouth in music” by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with [Rob Thomas](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Thomas) of the band [Matchbox Twenty](http://www.last.fm/music/Matchbox+Twenty).      A fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, was released August 2009. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor.

"James Robert Wills (March 6, 1905 – May 13, 1975), better known as Bob Wills, was an American Western swing musician, songwriter, and bandleader of [Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Wills+&+His+Texas+Playboys). Considered by music authorities as the co-founder of Western swing, he was universally known as the King of Western Swing.   Wills formed several bands and played radio stations around the South and West until he formed the Texas Playboys in 1934 with Wills on fiddle, Tommy Duncan on piano and vocals, rhythm guitarist June Whalin, tenor banjoist Johnnie Lee Wills, and Kermit Whalin, who played steel guitar and bass. The band played regularly on a Tulsa, Oklahoma radio station, and added Leon McAuliffe on steel guitar, pianist Al Stricklin, drummer Smokey Dacus, and a horn section that expanded the band’s sound. Wills favored jazz-like arrangements and the band found national popularity into the 1940s with such hits as “Steel Guitar Rag”, “New San Antonio Rose”, “Smoke on the Water”, “Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima”, and “New Spanish Two Step”.   Wills and the Texas Playboys recorded with several publishers and companies, including Vocalion, Okeh, Columbia, and MGM, frequently moving. In 1950, he had two top ten hits, “Ida Red Likes the Boogie” and “Faded Love”, which were his last hits for a decade. Throughout the 1950s, he struggled with poor health and tenuous finances, but continued to perform frequently despite the decline in popularity of his earlier music as rock and roll took over. Wills had a heart attack in 1962 and a second one the next year, which forced him to disband the Playboys although Wills continued to perform solo.   The Country Music Hall of Fame inducted Wills in 1968 and the Texas State Legislature honored him for his contribution to American music.[4] In 1972, Wills accepted a citation from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in Nashville. He was recording an album with fan Merle Haggard in 1973 when a stroke left him comatose until his death in 1975. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Wills and the Texas Playboys in 1999.         He was born near Kosse, Texas; his father was a fiddle player who along with his grandfather, taught the young Wills to play the fiddle and the mandolin. After several years of drifting, “Jim Rob,” then in his 20s, attended barber school, got married, and moved first to Roy, New Mexico then to Turkey, Texas (now considered his home town) to be a barber. He alternated barbering and fiddling even when he moved to Fort Worth to pursue a career in music. It was there that while performing in a medicine show, where he learned comic timing and some of the famous “patter” he later delivered on his records, the show’s owner gave him the nickname “Bob.”   In Fort Worth, Wills met Herman Arnspinger and formed The Wills Fiddle Band",593618,country,"['country', 'country rock', 'nashville sound', 'outlaw country', 'texas country', 'traditional country']",bob wills,69,"['Bob Wills Is Still the King', 'Bubbles In My Beer', 'Stay All Night (Stay A Little Longer)', 'Lone Star Beer and Bob Wills', 'Bob Wills Is Still the King - Live', 'Bob Wills Is Still the King', 'Take Me Back To Tulsa', 'Ida Red', 'San Antonio Rose', ""19 Somethin'""]"
"Michael Lawrence Tyler (born September 22, 1970 in New Orleans, Louisiana), better known by his stage name Mystikal, is a Grammy award nominated American rapper and actor. He released his self-titled debut album in 1994 and has since released 1996’s Mind of Mystikal, 1997’s Unpredictable, 1998’s Ghetto Fabulous, 2000’s Let’s Get Ready and 2001’s Tarantula. In 2003, Mystikal pled guilty to sexual battery, and was released on January 14, 2010 after serving a six year sentence. He has plans to return to recording music and possibly release a new album sometime in 2010. He is one of many artists from [Master P](http://www.last.fm/music/Master+P)’s No Limit Records to achieve both critical and commercial success.      Michael Tyler went to Cohen High School in New Orleans. Later he would go on to be in the Army and serve as a Meal, Ready-to-Eat supply clerk assigned to a stateside support unit.      His debut album was Mystikal, released on the indie label Big Boy Records in 1995. He signed to Jive Records to release Mind of Mystikal in 1996. The album sold well, and he signed to Master P’s No Limit Records for Unpredictable in 1997. The album sold well, and garnered him critical praise, though his real breakthrough was Let’s Get Ready released in 2000, led by The Neptunes- produced hit “Shake Ya Ass,” and the only slightly-less-successful single “Danger (Been So Long),” which featured rising pop star Nivea. It debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, making it his only chart-topper to date.   One of his most recent releases was the 2001 album Tarantula, which contained the single, “Bouncin’ Back (Bumpin’ Me Against The Wall)”. Though it presented Mystikal’s typical and unique flow style, the song also saw a blending of jazz and swing elements with hip-hop. He was also featured on “Move Bitch” by Ludacris.   On January 16, 2004 Mystikal was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to forcing his hairstylist to perform sex acts. He also admitted to extortion. The rapper and two bodyguards forced the woman to perform oral sex after they accused her of stealing $80,000 in checks. Mystikal initinally denied the assault, but confessed after a videotape of the crime was found at his home. Bodyguards Leland “Pokie” Ellis and Vercy “V” Carter also pled guilty to sexual battery. Mystikal’s 2006 parole hearing led to a denial of parole, specifically “1002186 SEXUAL BATTERY OF INFIRM” and “702127 EXTORTION.”   He is currently incarcerated at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, which is just outside of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His D.O.C. number is 00469659.      In August 2005, while incarcerated on the state sexual battery and extortion charges, Mystikal was charged federally with two misdemeanor counts of failing to file tax returns for 1998 and 1999. On January 12, 2006, he was convicted in federal court of the tax offenses, but was allowed to serve the one year federal sentence concurrent with his six year state sentence",861742,jazz,"['boston hip hop', 'hip hop', 'pop rap', 'rap']",mystikal,78,"['FYM (feat.

"Ralph Stanley (born in 25 February 1927) is an American bluegrass musician.      Stanley was born in Big Spraddle Creek, Virginia, near Stratton, Dickenson County, Virginia, USA.      The son of Lucy and Lee Stanley, Ralph Edmond Stanley grew up in rural southwestern Virginia. Ralph learned to play the banjo claw-hammer style from his mother. It was her inspiration, coupled with Ralph’s natural ability, which led Ralph and his older guitar-playing brother Carter to form the Stanley Brothers Band in 1946 after his service abroad during World War 2. Drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area - the holiness singing of the Primitive Baptist Church and the sweet downhome family harmonies of the Carter Family- the Stanleys began honing their own special style of music by singing at local events in the early 1940s.      He and his brother Carter performed as the Stanley Brothers with their band the Clinch Mountain Boys from 1946 to 1966. After Carter’s death in 1966, Ralph continued to perform, eventually reviving the Clinch Mountain Boys. Larry Sparks, Roy Lee Centers, Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, and Charlie Sizemore were among those who played in the revived band. Stanley has maintained an extensive touring schedule into 2003. His work was featured in the 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? in which he sings the dirge “O Death.” Stanley was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1992 and has come to be known in the world of bluegrass music by the popular title, “Dr. Ralph Stanley” after being awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tennessee, 1976.      Ralph created a unique style of banjo playing, sometimes called “Stanley Style”. This style evolved from Scruggs style three finger. Stanley style is distinguished by incredibly fast “forward rolls” (a technique in banjo playing) led by the index finger, sometimes in the higher registers of his instrument utilizing the capo.

"         Early Career, Controversy, & First Hiatus (1981–1986)      Suicidal Tendencies formed in 1981 as a punk band in Venice, California. The original lineup of the band consisted of Mike Muir on vocals, Mike Ball on guitar, Carlos “Egie” Egert on drums, and Mike Dunnigan on bass. After the recording of their first demo, Carlos Egert left the band and was replaced by Dunnigan’s brother, Sean. Muir, at the time a student at Santa Monica College, originally only intended Suicidal Tendencies as a “party band”, but as they grew in notoriety he soon found the band at the center of his life. Suicidal Tendencies had a rough start including being voted “Worst Band/Biggest Assholes” in Flipside in 1982 but the following year were voted “Best New Band”. There were many rumors of the band members as well as their friends and followers being involved with gangs (especially the Venice White Boyz), with Muir’s trademark blue bandanna and violence at the band’s performances as evidence. In their original lineup photo, which can be seen inside their self- titled debut album, drummer Amery Smith is wearing a flipped up hat and under the bill are the markings “V13”, which are initials for the gang Venice 13. Though there were probably a handful of V13 members who also became ST fans, Amery was not a member of V13 but bassist Louiche Mayorga’s brother Steve Mayorga was (and that’s whose hat he’s wearing for the photo). Eventually an entire gang sprung up around the group, the Suicidal Cycos (also known as the Suicidals, Suis or Suicidal Boyz) with chapters in Venice, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Orange County, Oceanside, San Diego and even a chapter in San Antonio, Texas.      Suicidal Tendencies quickly gained a following and began performing at larger gigs. They recorded a demo in 1982 and were featured on the Slamulation compilation LP on Mystic Records. The song featured was “I Saw Your Mommy”, which was later featured on their self-titled debut album. The Dunnigan brothers quit after these recordings, with Mike Dunnigan later joining Tony Alva’s band The Skoundrelz to be back with Mike Ball on guitar and Bela Horvath on drums. Ball stayed in the band for 2½ years before joining The Skoundrelz and was replaced by Dunnigan. Guitarist Rick Battson recorded the demo before the first album. Grant Estes learned that demo replacing him on guitar and playing on Suicidal’s first record.      All this controversy helped the band gain label attention, and in 1983 Suicidal signed with the independent label Frontier Records and released their self-titled debut. It was described by critic Steve Huey as “Fast, furious, and funny… Mike Muir proves himself an articulate lyricist and commentator, delving into subjects like alienation, depression, and nonconformist politics with intelligence and humor",333058,,"['alternative metal', 'crossover thrash', 'funk metal', 'groove metal', 'hard rock', 'hardcore punk', 'metal', 'nu metal', 'old school thrash', 'punk', 'rap rock', 'rock', 'speed metal', 'thrash metal']",suicidal tendencies,55,"['Institutionalized', 'Subliminal', 'Cyco Vision', ""You Can't Bring Me Down"", 'Suicidal Failure', 'How Will I Laugh Tomorrow', 'I Saw Your Mommy...', ""Suicide's an Alternative / You'll Be Sorry"", 'Suicidal Tendencies (feat.

Grohl formed the group as a one-man project after the dissolution of his previous band [Nirvana](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana) in 1994. Prior to the release of [Foo Fighters](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Foo+Fighters) in 1995, Grohl drafted [Nate Mendel](http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Mendel) (bass), William Goldsmith (drums) (both of [Sunny Day Real Estate](http://www.last.fm/music/Sunny+Day+Real+Estate) and [The Fire Theft](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fire+Theft)), and [Pat Smear](http://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Smear) (guitar) (of [The Germs](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Germs)) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group’s second album [The Colour and the Shape](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape) (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by [Taylor Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Hawkins) and [Franz Stahl](http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Stahl), respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group’s third album, [There Is Nothing Left to Lose](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose) (1999).      [Chris Shiflett](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Shiflett) joined as the band’s second guitarist after the completion of [There Is Nothing Left to Lose](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose). The band released its fourth album [One by One](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One) in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc [In Your Honor](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/In+Your+Honor) (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album [Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace](http://www.last.f m/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes,+Silence,+Patience+&+Grace) in 2007. Over the course of the band’s career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys. The band’s seventh album [Wasting Light](http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Wasting+Light) was released in 2011 and peaked at #1 in several countries.      **Formation and debut album**   [Dave Grohl](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl) joined the band [Nirvana](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana) as the group’s drummer in 1990.

"**Godflesh** are an [industrial metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20metal) band from Birmingham, England, formed in 1988 by Justin Karl Broadrick (guitar, vocals, and programming) and G. C. Green (bass). They are highly regarded as one of the founders of [industrial metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20metal). The group disbanded in 2002 but reformed in 2010, appearing in few festivals and starting to produce a new studio album.      In 1988, Broadrick contacted Green about reforming [Fall Of Because](http://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Of+Because), who fell apart in 1987. Justin decided to take over on guitars, and they chose to use a drum machine to replace Justin as a drummer. The newly formed band decided to change their name to Godflesh.      Godflesh established a presence in underground music with albums such as [Streetcleaner](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Streetcleaner) and [Pure](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Pure), which demonstrated the effectiveness of lo-fi production values in heavy music. A brief flirtation with major label Columbia Records in 1994 for [Selfless](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Selfless) and the [Merciless](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Merciless) EP saw the duo take on a more high-end production approach. In 1996 Godflesh released [Songs of Love and Hate](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Songs+of+Love+and+Hate), which featured the drumming of Bryan Mantia ([Guns N’ Roses](http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses), [Primus](http://www.last.fm/music/Primus), [Praxis](http://www.last.fm/music/Praxis)). The next album, 1999’s [Us And Them](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Us+And+Them), saw the group experimenting with a more electronic, drum and bass-oriented sound in which the guitar played a less central role. In 2001 Godflesh released the double album retrospective [In All Languages](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/In+All+Languages). That same year they released an album of new material, [Hymns](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Hymns), which featured the precise drumming of new band member Ted Parsons (formerly of [Swans](http://www.last.fm/music/Swans) and [Prong](http://www.last.fm/music/Prong)) and brought the band back to its slow and heavy roots while retaining elements of its experiments with electronica.      Green left the band in late 2001. It was announced that he would be replaced by former Killing Joke and Prong bassist Paul Raven; however, Godflesh disbanded in 2002 when Broadrick suffered a nervous breakdown just before departing for a tour of the U.S. As a kind of parting gift, the group released a remastered version of their extremely rare 1994 EP [Messiah](http://www.last.fm/music/Godflesh/Messiah), which was doubled in length with all new remixes. Broadrick and Parsons went on to form [Jesu](http://www.last.fm/music/Jesu) in 2003.

"Eddie James House, Jr. (March 21, 1902 – October 19, 1988), better known as Son House, was an influential blues singer and guitarist. His date of birth is a matter of some debate. Son House himself alleged that he was middle aged during World War I, and, more specifically, that he was 79 in 1965, which would mean that he was born around 1886. However, all legal records place his birth on March 21, 1902.      House was born, the middle of three brothers, in Riverton, Mississippi, two miles from famed blues capital Clarksdale, Mississippi. Around age seven or eight, he was brought by his mother to Tallulah, Louisiana after his parents separated. The young Son House was determined to become a Baptist preacher, and at age fifteen began his preaching career. Despite the church’s firm stand against blues music and the sinful world which revolved around it, House nevertheless became attracted to it and taught himself guitar in his midtwenties, inspired by the work of Willie Wilson. He began playing alongside Charley Patton, Willie Brown, Robert Johnson, Fiddlin’ Joe Martin, Leroy Williams, and Howlin’ Wolf, around Robinsonville, Mississippi and north to Memphis, Tennessee until 1942.      After killing a man, allegedly in self-defense, he spent time on Parchman Farm in 1928 and 1929.      Son House recorded for Paramount Records in 1930 and for Alan Lomax from the Library of Congress in 1941 and 1942. He then faded from public view until the country blues revival in the 1960s when, after a long search of the Mississippi Delta region by Nick Perls, Dick Waterman and Phil Spero, he was “re-discovered” in June, 1964 in Rochester, New York where he had lived since 1943; House had been retired from the music business for many years, working for the New York Central Railroad, and was completely unaware of the international revival of enthusiasm for his early recordings. He subsequently toured extensively in the US and Europe and recorded for CBS records. Like Mississippi John Hurt he was welcomed into the music scene of the 1960s and played at Newport Folk Festival in 1964, the New York Folk Festival in July, 1965, and the October, 1967 European tour of the American Folk Festival along with Skip James and Bukka White. In the summer of 1970, House toured Europe once again, including an appearance at the Montreux Festival; a recording of his London concerts was released by Liberty Records.      Ill health plagued his later years and in 1974 he retired once again, and later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he remained until his death from cancer of the larynx. He was buried at Mt. Hazel Cemetery on Lahser south of Seven Mile. Members of the Detroit Blues Society raised money through benefit concerts to put a fitting monument on his grave. He had been married five times.      Unlike some blues guitarists of the 1920s and 30s, House was not a virtuoso although there is still much that is technically impressive about his playing",121653,blues,"['bc underground hip hop', 'country rap']",son house,62,"['House in the Hills', 'Death Letter Blues', ""Grinnin' In Your Face"", 'House and the Rising Son', 'John the Revelator', 'In the Valley of the Dying Son', 'Levee Camp Blues', 'Pack Son', 'Son of the Wolf (Live)', 'John the Revelator']"
"John Michael “Ozzy” Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English heavy metal vocalist, songwriter, and television personality. Osbourne rose to prominence in the early 1970s as the lead vocalist of the pioneering band Black Sabbath, whose dark and heavy sound has often been cited as key to the development of the heavy metal genre. Osbourne left Black Sabbath in 1979 and has since had a successful solo career, releasing 11 studio albums, the first seven of which were all awarded multi-platinum certifications in the US, though he has reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions, most recently in 2011 to record the album 13, which was released in 2013. Osbourne’s longevity and success have earned him the informal title of “Godfather of Heavy Metal”.      Osbourne’s total album sales from his years in Black Sabbath combined with his solo work is over 100 million. As a member of Black Sabbath he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as both a solo artist and as a member of the band. He has a star on the Birmingham Walk of Stars in his hometown, and also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In the early 2000s, he became a TV star, appearing as himself in the MTV reality program The Osbournes, alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack.

"Music icon Anne Murray has sold more than 50 million albums in a distinguished career that spans four decades. On January 15th, Manhattan/EMI will release Anne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends, an exceptional 17-track collection of her top hits and favorites, newly recorded as duets with some of the world’s top female recording artists.      Anne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends showcases a wide variety of Anne’s favorite female vocalists. Among the album’s tracks and collaborating artists are “Snowbird” with Sarah Brightman, “You Needed Me” with Shania Twain, “Nobody Loves Me Like You Do” with Anne’s daughter Dawn Langstroth, “Danny’s Song” with Martina McBride, “Another Pot O’ Tea” with Emmylou Harris, “A Little Good News” with Indigo Girls, “Cotton Jenny” with Olivia Newton-John, “Could I Have This Dance” with Amy Grant, “Daydream Believer” with Nelly Furtado, “A Love Song” with k.d. lang, “Time Don’t Run Out On Me” with the song’s writer, Carole King, and more.      In 1979, Anne and Dusty Springfield each recorded the song “I Just Fall In Love Again.” Anne’s version became a hit single that garnered her Canada’s Juno Award for “Single of the Year” in 1980. Anne and Dusty remained friends until Dusty’s passing in 1999, and for Anne, releasing an album with this type of sisterly theme wouldn’t seem complete without Dusty’s inclusion. With the blessing of the Springfield family and estate, a new version pairing Dusty’s original with Anne’s newly recorded vocals is featured on the album.      Anne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends was produced by one of the most respected music producers in the world, Phil Ramone (Tony Bennett, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel), who counts 14 Grammy Awards and 32 Grammy nominations among his many honors. Together, Anne and Phil decided they would treat the songs on their own terms and not adhere rigidly to the arrangements of Anne’s classic versions. While Anne had designs on how she imagined the arrangements, she gave Phil free rein to rework the songs.   “We approached the sessions as if we were just handed these songs and told to make this record,” explains Ramone. “While arrangements were changed, there are also licks on some songs that I didn’t mess with. We stayed true to the song.”   Working with Anne for the first time, Ramone adds, was an easy task. “What I love about Anne is there are no words minced about whatever she feels,” he says. “This is not a person you have to think, ‘Will she tell me the truth?’ When we met for a few hours in Michigan before we started, we agreed we wanted to bring some daring ideas and some freshness to this album.”   “I said to Phil,” joked Anne, “The only reason I asked you was that I’m the only singer left that you haven’t worked with!”   “I’ve done duets throughout my career,” Anne says. “I did duets when I started out on (CBC Television’s) ‘Singalong Jubilee.’ I did a duets album in 1971 with Glen Campbell",230428,classic,"['adult standards', 'bubblegum pop', 'canadian country', 'canadian pop', 'folk', 'mellow gold', 'nashville sound', 'soft rock']",anne murray,56,"['Could I Have This Dance', 'You Needed Me', ""Danny's Song"", 'I Just Fall In Love Again', 'Snowbird', 'Broken Hearted Me', 'Just Another Woman In Love', 'If I Ever Fall in Love Again - Duet with Anne Murray', 'Nobody Loves Me Like You Do', 'Tennessee Waltz']"
"**Benny Goodman**, born Benjamin David Goodman, (May 30, 1909 – June 13, 1986) was an American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) musician, known as _King of Swing_, _Patriarch of the Clarinet_, _The Professor_, and _Swing’s Senior Statesman_.      Goodman was regarded by some as a demanding taskmaster, by others an arrogant and eccentric martinet. Many musicians spoke of _The Ray_, Goodman’s trademark glare that he bestowed on a musician who failed to perform to his demanding standards. [Anita O’Day](http://www.last.fm/music/Anita+O%27Day) and [Helen Forrest](http://www.last.fm/music/Helen+Forrest) spoke bitterly of their experiences singing with Goodman. “The twenty or so months I spent with Benny felt like twenty years,” said Forrest. “When I look back, they seem like a life sentence.” He could also be incredibly self-absorbed; it is reported that when eating an egg onto which a ketchup bottle cap had fallen, Goodman simply ate around it. At the same time, there are reports that he privately funded several college educations and was sometimes very generous, though always secretly. When a friend asked him why one time, he reportedly said, “Well, if they knew about it, everyone would come to me with their hand out.”      Some suggest that [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley) had the same success with [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) that Goodman achieved with jazz and [swing](http://www.last.fm/tag/swing). Without Goodman there would not have been a swing era. It is true that many of Goodman’s arrangements had been played for years before by [Fletcher Henderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Fletcher+Henderson)’s orchestra. While Goodman publicly acknowledged his debt to Henderson, many young white swing fans had never heard Henderson’s band. While most consider Goodman a jazz innovator, others maintain his main strength was his perfectionism and drive. Goodman was a non - pariel virtuoso clarinetist and -along with only Artie Shaw, amongst the most technically proficient jazz clarinetists of all time.      Goodman is also responsible for a significant step in racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white jazz musicians could not play together in most clubs or concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by the [Jim Crow laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws). **Benny Goodman** broke with tradition by hiring [Teddy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Wilson) to play with him ] in the Autumn of 1936. He then added [Lionel Hampton](http://www.last.fm/music/Lionel+Hampton) on vibes in December, 1936, and in the early Summer of 1939 he augmented the famous “quartette” with pioneering jazz guitarist [Charlie Christian](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Christian) to his band and small ensembles, who played with him until his untimely death from tuberculosis less than three years later",211566,jazz,"['adult standards', 'bebop', 'big band', 'jazz', 'jazz clarinet', 'lounge', 'stride', 'swing', 'vintage jazz', 'vocal jazz']",benny goodman,56,"['Sing, Sing, Sing', 'Benny Goodman', 'Sing, Sing, Sing', 'Stompin At The Savoy', 'Chicago', 'Where Or When', ""Don't Be That Way"", 'Sing, Sing, Sing (Parts 1 & 2) - Live', ""Why Don't You Do Right?

"**Elvis Aaron Presley** (Tupelo, Mississippi, January 8, 1935 - Memphis, Tennessee, August 16, 1977), was an American singer, song producer and actor. A cultural icon, he is widely known by the single name Elvis.       Elvis Presley began his music career at [Sun Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Sun+Records) in the spring of 1954 when [Sam Philips](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sam+Philips) recorded Elvis performing several of Elvis’ favorite songs with [Scotty Moore](http://www.last.fm/music/Scotty+Moore) (guitar) and [Bill Black](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Black) (bass). One of these covers was a country and western song, “[Blue Moon of Kentucky](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Blue+Moon+of+Kentucky)”.   Elvis is the best-selling solo artist of all time in the United States with confirmed 189.2 million records in RIAA shipments.      Before [Sam Philips](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sam+Philips) sold Elvis’ contract to [rca victor](http://www.last.fm/label/rca+victor) in 1956 for $35,000 they had recorded six two-sided singles. Each of these recordings featured a [country and western](http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20and%20western) song on one side and a [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues) song on the other. One of the reasons Elvis was so popular was because of his ability to merge attributes of what was perceived to be “white” (C&W) and “black” (R&B) music. An example of this is evident in Elvis’ hit song “[Heartbreak Hotel](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Heartbreak+Hotel)” which reached #1 not only in the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) charts, but the R&B and C&W charts as well. This was the first time that a single song held the #1 spot in all three charts.      Elvis remains a popular and enigmatic star. His legend has only grown stronger since his death. In fact, there is a widespread belief that Elvis—who was known by his first name—did not die in 1977. Many fans persist in claiming he is still alive, that he went into hiding for various reasons. This claim is allegedly backed up by thousands of so-called Elvis sightings that have occurred in the years since his death, and by the fact that his middle name Aron was misspelled Aaron, with two As, on his tombstone.      During an active recording career that spanned more than two decades, Presley set and broke many records for both concert attendance and sales. Some of those records have since been matched and/or broken by other artists, but some of his records will probably remain unbroken and/or unmatched forever. He has had more than 120 singles in the US top 40, across various musical genres, with over 20 reaching number one.      Elvis Aaron (sometimes spelled Aron) Presley, in the humblest of circumstances, was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child",3382236,country,"['rock-and-roll', 'rockabilly']",elvis presley,79,"[""Can't Help Falling in Love"", 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Hound Dog', 'Suspicious Minds', 'Burning Love', 'Blue Suede Shoes', 'Heartbreak Hotel', 'All Shook Up', ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""(You're The) Devil in Disguise""]"
"Arthur Arshawsky (23 May 1910 – 30 December 2004), better known as Artie Shaw, was an accomplished [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) alto saxophonist, clarinetist, composer, arranger, bandleader, and author.   He was born in New York City (but grew up in New Haven, Connecticut) and began learning the saxophone when he was 15 and by age 16, had begun to tour with a band. He reached Hollywood the first time, as a sideman with Irving Aaronson’s band in 1931, performing at the famous Orange Blossom Room (site of the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929). Returning to New York City in1932, he became a highly in-demand session musician, working for example as one of just a handful of accompanists to Bing Crosby’s first signature radio show for William S. Paley’s already powerful and influential CBS radio network. Ultimately, Artie (who was known strictly as “Art” Shaw until his fortuitous Summer, 1938 contract with RCA Victor records’ Bluebird label commenced) organized and led five, full-time touring orchestras that were all extremely popular -save the last, from 1949, with its be-bop oriented book. Ironically, that final Shaw-led big band (populated with players like Al Cohn), is considered by most jazz critics to have been Artie’s best. With time out to lead a Navy service band (in the Pacific combat theater) during WWII, Shaw’s actual big band- leading career lasted less than a decade overall -yet, it was a remarkably productive one, populated with some fourteen “Gold” records. These included such mega-hits as “Begin the Beguine”, “Stardust”, “Frenesi”, “Moonglow”, “Temptation”, “Dancing In The Dark” and “Summit Ridge Drive” -the latter by his famous quintet billed as the Gramercy 5.      Shaw was known for being an innovator in the big band idiom, pioneering strings with jazz and using unusual instrumentations. His Summer, 1935 piece “Interlude in B-flat” was one of the earliest examples of what would be later dubbed “third stream”. In 1938 he convinced Billie Holiday to be his band’s vocalist, becoming the first white bandleader to hire a full-time black female singer. This 1938-1939 orchestra became phenomenonally successful and appeared in the movie “Dancing Co-ed” which also featured one of his future wives, Lana Turner, in the cast. Artie’s clarinet playing, had by now reached a level that was arguably the greatest in jazz, easily rivaling that of Benny Goodman. Longtime Duke Ellington clarinetist Barney Bigard, himself a highly talented musician -cited Shaw (in 1940) as his “favorite” clarinet player. Literally abandoning his famous 1938-1939 band at the absolute peak of its’ fame and earning power (Artie, just himself alone pulling down more than $10K per week) in late November, 1939, Shaw “abdicated” to Acapulco, Mexico. Returning to the U.S. he organized an entirely new orchestra, with full string section in the Summer of 1940",49553,jazz,"['adult standards', 'big band', 'jazz clarinet', 'lounge', 'stride', 'swing', 'vocal jazz']",artie shaw,48,"['Begin the Beguine', 'Moonglow', 'Begin The Beguine', 'The Chant', 'Frenesi', 'Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise', 'St. James Infirmary Blues (Parts I & II)', 'Nightmare', 'Stardust', 'Deep In A Dream']"

She soon landed her own series on a radio show sponsored by a local restaurant that paid her “salary” in food. Both during and after her high school years, she took whatever jobs she could find, waitressing and singing for paltry sums on other local stations.

"Dolly Rebecca Parton (born January 19, 1946 in Sevierville, Tennessee, U.S.) is an American country singer, songwriter, composer, producer, entrepreneur, author and actress.      Parton began performing as a child, singing on local radio and television in East Tennessee. At age 12 she was appearing on Knoxville TV, and at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. When she graduated from high school in 1964 she moved to Nashville, taking many traditional elements of folklore and popular music from East Tennessee with her.      Parton’s initial success came as a songwriter, with her songs being covered by Kitty Wells, Hank Williams, Jr., Skeeter Davis, and a number of others. She signed with Monument Records in late 1965, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer, earning only one national chart single, “Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,” which did not crack the Billboard Top 100. Additional pop singles also failed to chart.      The label agreed to have Parton sing country music after her composition “Put It Off Until Tomorrow” as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony) went to No. 6 on the country charts in 1966. Her first country single, “Dumb Blonde” (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but didn’t write), reached No. 24 country 1967, followed later the same year with “Something Fishy,” which went to No. 17. The two songs anchored her first full-length album, Hello I’m Dolly, that same year.      In 1967, Parton was asked to join the weekly syndicated country music TV program hosted by Porter Wagoner, replacing Norma Jean. She also signed with RCA Records, Wagoner’s label, during this period, where she would remain for the next two decades. Wagoner and Parton immediately began a hugely successful career as a vocal duet in addition to their solo work and their first single together, a cover of Tom Paxton’s “The Last Thing on My Mind,” reached the top ten on the U.S. country charts in late 1967, and was the first of over a dozen duet singles to chart for them during the next several years.      Parton is a hugely successful songwriter, having begun by writing country songs with strong elements of folk music in them based upon her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings. Her songs “Coat of Many Colors” and “Jolene” have become classics in the field, as have a number of others. As a composer, she is also regarded as one of country music’s most gifted storytellers, with many of her narrative songs based on persons and events from her childhood.      In 1982 Dolly Parton sang her song “I Will Always Love You”, for the movie “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas”, starring Parton and Burt Reynolds. The song - originally composed around 1974 - made few ripples, but it wasn’t until Whitney Houston re-recorded it for “The Bodyguard” a decade later, that the song made yet another international hit for Dolly Parton",857205,country,"['country', 'country dawn', 'traditional country']",dolly parton,73,"['9 to 5', 'Jolene', 'Islands In the Stream', 'Here You Come Again', 'God Only Knows', 'I Will Always Love You', ""When I Get Where I'm Going (feat.

"James Melvin “Jimmie” Lunceford (June 6, 1902 – July 12, 1947) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and bandleader in the swing era.      Lunceford was born in Fulton, Mississippi. Little is known about his parents, though his father was a choirmaster in Warren, Ohio, before the family moved to Denver. Lunceford went to high school in Denver and studied music under Wilberforce J. Whiteman, father of Paul Whiteman, whose band was soon to acquire a national reputation. As a child in Denver, he learned several instruments. He played alto saxophone in the band led by the violinist George Morrison. After high school, Lunceford continued his studies at Fisk University. In 1922, he played alto saxophone in a local band led by George Morrison which included Andy Kirk, another musician destined for fame as a bandleader.      In 1927, while an athletic instructor at Manassas High School in Memphis, Tennessee, he organized a student band, the Chickasaw Syncopators, whose name was changed to the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra. Under the new name, the band started its professional career in 1929, and made its first recordings in 1930. Lunceford was the first high school band director in Memphis. After a period of touring, the band accepted a booking at the Harlem nightclub The Cotton Club in 1934 for their revue ‘Cotton Club Parade’ starring Adelaide Hall. The Cotton Club had already featured Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, who won their first widespread fame from their inventive shows for the Cotton Club’s all-white patrons. Lunceford’s orchestra, with their tight musicianship and the often outrageous humor in their music and lyrics, made an ideal band for the club, and Lunceford’s reputation began to steadily grow. Jimmie Luncefords band differed from other great bands of the time because their work was better known for its ensemble than its solo work. Additionally, he was known for using a two-beat rhythm, called the Lunceford two-beat, as opposed to the standard four-beat rhythm. This distinctive “Lunceford style” was largely the result of the imaginative arrangements by trumpeter Sy Oliver, which set high standards for dance-band arrangers of the time.   Though not well known as a musician, Jimmie Lunceford was trained on several instruments and was even featured on flute in “Liza”.   Comedy and vaudeville played a distinct part in Lunceford’s presentation. Songs such as “Rhythm Is Our Business” (featured in a 1937 musical short with Myra Johnson (Taylor) on vocals), “I’m Nuts about Screwy Music”, “I Want the Waiter (With the Water)”, and “Four or Five Times” displayed a playful sense of swing, often through clever arrangements by trumpeter Sy Oliver and bizarre lyrics. Lunceford’s stage shows often included costumes, skits, and obvious jabs at mainstream white bands, such as Paul Whiteman’s and Guy Lombardo’s",9257,jazz,"['big band', 'ragtime', 'stride', 'swing', 'vintage jazz']",jimmie lunceford,35,"[""Tain't What You Do (It's The Way That You Do It)"", ""Posin'"", ""T'Aint What You Do (It's The Way That You Do It)"", 'For Dancers Only', ""Ain't She Sweet"", 'Le Jazz Hot', 'Rhythm Is Our Business', 'Chillun, Get Up', 'Margie', 'Uptown Blues']"
"Charlie Barnet (October 26, 1913 - September 4, 1991) was unusual in several ways. One of the few jazzmen to be born a millionaire, Barnet was a bit of a playboy throughout his life, ending up with a countless number of ex-wives and anecdotes. He was one of the few white big band leaders of the swing era to openly embrace the music of Duke Ellington (he also greatly admired Count Basie). Barnet was a pioneer in leading integrated bands (as early as 1935). And, although chiefly a tenor saxophonist (where he developed an original sound out of the style of Coleman Hawkins), Barnet was an effective emulator of Johnny Hodges on alto in addition to being virtually the only soprano player (other than Sidney Bechet) in the 1930s and ’40s.      And yet Charlie Barnet was only significant in jazz for about a decade (1939-1949). Although his family wanted him to be a lawyer, he was a professional musician by the time he was 16 and ironically in his career made more money than he would have in business. Barnet arrived in New York in 1932 and started leading bands on records the following year, but his career was quite erratic until 1939. Many of Barnet’s early records are worthy but some are quite commercial as he attempted to find a niche. Best is a sideman appearance on a 1934 Red Norvo date that also includes Artie Shaw and Teddy Wilson.      In 1939, with the hit recording of “Cherokee” and a very successful run at the Famous Door in New York, Charlie Barnet soon became a household name. In addition to the fine trumpeter Bobby Burnet (who soloed on many of Barnet’s Bluebird records), such sidemen as guitarist Bus Etri; drummer Cliff Leeman; singers Lena Horne, Francis Wayne, and Kay Starr; pianist Dodo Marmarosa; clarinetist Buddy DeFranco; guitarist Barney Kessel; and even trumpeter Roy Eldridge spent time with Barnet’s bands. Although at the height of his popularity during 1939-1942 (when his orchestra could often play a close imitation of Ellington’s), Barnet’s recordings for Decca during 1942-1946 were also of great interest with “Skyliner” being a best-seller.      By 1947 Barnet was starting to look toward bop. Clark Terry was his star trumpeter that year, and in 1949 his screaming trumpet section included Maynard Ferguson, Doc Severinsen, Rolf Ericson, and Ray Wetzel. Barnet, however, soon lost interest and near the end of 1949 he broke up his band. Semi-retired throughout the remainder of his life, Charlie Barnet occasionally led swing-oriented big bands during short tours and appearances, making his last recording in 1966.

"ZZ Top is an American [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock) band, formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band members are Billy Gibbons (vocals and guitar), Dusty Hill (bass guitar and vocals), and Frank Beard (drums). They hold the distinction of being one of the few rock bands still comprised of its original members for over 40 years, and until 2006, with the same manager/producer, Bill Ham.      They reached the peak of their commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s, scoring many hit songs during that era; but they remain together today and are still touring and releasing albums. ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2004. Summarizing their music, Cub Koda wrote, “As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers; Gibbons is one of America’s finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom … while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support.”[1] Their song lyrics often feature sexual innuendo and humor.      Nearly as well-known as their music is the group’s appearance: Gibbons and Hill are always pictured wearing sunglasses (a nod to their 1979 song “Cheap Sunglasses”), similar (if not matching) clothing, and their trademark chest- length beards, while Beard sports a mustache but not a beard. In 1984, the Gillette Company reportedly offered Gibbons and Hill US$1 million apiece to shave their beards for a television commercial, but they declined.      The origin of the band’s name was not officially known for many years. Some theories included: the two brands of rolling paper, Zig-Zag and Top; a tribute to blues legend Z. Z. Hill; Z-shaped barn-door braces Gibbons once saw at a farm; and/or Billy Gibbons seeing the two words running together on a dilapidated bill board. The real origin, as told by Billy Gibbons and also recorded in his new book (Rock + Roll Gearhead), is derived from the name of blues master B.B. King. They wanted to call themselves Z.Z. King but sounded too similar to their blues legend hero. They figured that “King” was at the “top” so thus settled on ZZ Top.      The men who would form ZZ Top had played in several different Texas-based groups (including the Moving Sidewalks, The Cellar Dwellers, The Hustlers, The Warlocks and American Blues) before joining forces in late 1969.      They toured almost continually for several years, but first gained wide acclaim with their third album, Tres Hombres (1973). It contained the classic song “La Grange”, referencing the bordello that is the subject of the musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.      The band continued touring, recording, and releasing albums until 1977, when they took an extended hiatus. Their long-time manager/producer/image maker Bill Ham used this time to negotiate a deal that allowed the band to keep control of their previous recordings, which would be distributed by their new label, Warner Brothers",2084737,blues,"['album rock', 'blues-rock', 'classic rock', 'hard rock', 'metal', 'rock']",zz top,71,"['Sharp Dressed Man - 2008 Remaster', 'La Grange - 2005 Remaster', ""Gimme All Your Lovin'"", 'Tush - 2006 Remaster', 'Legs - 2008 Remaster', 'Cheap Sunglasses', ""Mushmouth Shoutin'"", 'Viva Las Vegas', 'Snappy Kakkie', 'Rough Boy']"

At Reigate College he also met Paul Heaton and, at 18, he went to the Brighton Polytechnic to study a BA in English, Politics and Sociology. Although he had begun DJing some years before, it was at this time that he began to develop his skills on the thriving Brighton club scene.      In 1985 Cook’s friend Paul Heaton who lived in Hull had formed a guitar band called The Housemartins. [The Housemartins](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Housemartins)’ bassist had just quit on the eve of their first national tour. Cook had lost interest in the rock scene and could barely play a musical instrument, he agreed to move to Hull to join them. The band soon had a hit single with “Happy Hour”. They also reached number one just before Christmas 1986 with a version of “Caravan of Love” originally a hit the year before for Isley Jasper Isley. However, by 1988 they had split up. Heaton and the band’s drummer Dave Hemingway went on to form The Beautiful South, while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. It was at this time that he first started working with young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records. All Cook’s records released from that point onwards have involved both of them to varying degrees (Thornton is credited in 2004 as “Executive Producer” for example).      Cook formed [Beats International](http://www.last.fm/music/Beats+International), a loose confederation of studio musicians including vocalists Lindy Layton, Lester Noel, D.J. Baptiste, rapper MC Wildski, and keyboardist Andy Boucher. Their first album, Let Them Eat Bingo, included the number one single, “Dub Be Good to Me”. “Dub Be Good To Me” caused a legal dispute revolving around allegations of infringement of copyright through the liberal use of unauthorised samples: the bassline was a note-for-note lift from The Clash’s “The Guns Of Brixton” and the song also borrowed heavily from the [S.O.S. Band](http://www.last.fm/music/S.O.S.+Band)’s “Just Be Good to Me”. The 1991 follow-up album Excursion on the Version, an exploration of dub and reggae rhythms, failed to repeat the success of its predecessor.      Cook then formed [Freakpower](http://www.last.fm/music/Freakpower), with horn player and singer Ashley Slater",648572,reggae,"['big beat', 'electronic']",fatboy slim,66,"['Praise You - Radio Edit', 'The Rockafeller Skank', 'Right Here, Right Now', 'Weapon Of Choice', 'Praise You - Purple Disco Machine Remix', ""Body Movin' - Fatboy Slim Remix/2005 Remaster"", 'Gangster Trippin - Sultan + Shepard Remix', 'I See You Baby - Fatboy Slim Radio Edit', 'Right Here, Right Now - CamelPhat Radio Edit', 'Praise You']"
"Alan Eugene Jackson (born October 17, 1958) is an American [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) music singer, known for blending traditional honky tonk and mainstream country sounds and penning many of his own hits. He has recorded 14 studio albums, three Greatest Hits albums, two Christmas albums, one Gospel album and several compilations, all on the Arista Nashville label. More than 50 of his singles have appeared on Billboard’s list of the “Top 30 Country Songs”. Of Jackson’s entries, 35 were number-one hits, with 50 in the Top 10. He is the recipient of 2 Grammys, 16 CMA Awards, 17 ACM Awards and nominee of multiple other awards. He is a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Jackson has sold more than 60 million records worldwide.      Jackson was born to Joseph Eugene Jackson and Ruth Musick in Newnan, Georgia, and has four older siblings. As a youth, Jackson listened primarily to gospel music. Otherwise he was not a major music fan. However, a friend of his introduced him to the music of Gene Watson, John Anderson and Hank Williams Jr. Jackson attended the local Elm Street Elementary and Newnan High School, starting a band after high school. After a time, he and his wife of six years, Denise Jackson, moved from Newnan to Nashville where Jackson hoped to pursue music full-time.      Jackson sang in church as a child. He, his father, mother, and four sisters lived in a small home. At one point, his bed was in the hallway for lack of room. His mother lives in the home to this day. His first job, at 12, was in a shoe store. He wrote his first song in 1983.      In Tennessee, Jackson got a job in The Nashville Network’s mailroom. Denise got him connected to Glen Campbell, who helped him jumpstart his career. Jackson eventually signed with Arista.      His first album, 1989’s Here in the Real World, was a major hit, as was his second (1991) album, Don’t Rock the Jukebox. His 1992 album, A Lot About Livin’ (And a Little ‘Bout Love) was a success, spawning five major singles. Also in 1992, Randy Travis charted three singles co-written by Jackson: “Forever Together”, “Better Class of Losers”, and “I’d Surrender All”. Conversely, Travis co-wrote Jackson’s single “She’s Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)”.      In 1994 Jackson left his management company, Ten Ten Management, which had overseen his career up to that point, and switched to Gary Overton.      It was around this time that Jackson began also gaining fame for his song- writing skills. Other country music artists who have charted with songs co- written by Jackson, including Clay Walker (“If I Could Make a Living”), Chely Wright (“Till I Was Loved By You”)[5] and Faith Hill (“I Can’t Do That Anymore”).      His first album, 1990’s [Here In The Real World](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Jackson/Here+In+The+Real+World), was a major hit, as was his second (1991) album, [Don’t Rock the Jukebox](http://www.last",1055534,country,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road']",alan jackson,73,"[""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere"", 'Chattahoochee', ""As She's Walking Away (feat.

"Canned Heat is a blues-rock/boogie band that formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its own interpretations of blues material as well as for efforts to promote the interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts, [Alan Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Wilson) (1943 – 1970) and [Bob Hite](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Hite) (1943 – 1981), who took the name from Tommy Johnson’s 1928 Canned Heat Blues, a song about an alcoholic who has desperately turned to drinking Sterno, generically called “canned heat”. After appearances at Monterey and Woodstock, at the end of the ’60s the band had acquired worldwide notoriety with a lineup consisting of Bob Hite, vocals, Alan Wilson guitar, harmonica and vocals, [Henry Vestine](http://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Vestine) (1944 – 1997) or [Harvey Mandel](http://www.last.fm/music/Harvey+Mandel) on lead guitar, [Larry Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Taylor) on bass, and [Adolfo De La Parra](http://www.last.fm/music/Adolfo+De+La+Parra) on drums.      Since the early ’70s numerous personnel changes have occurred and today, in the fifth decade of the band’s existence, Fito de la Parra is the only original member from the glorious epoch. He has authored a book about the band’s career. Larry Taylor, whose presence in the band has not been steady, is the other surviving member from the earliest lineups. Harvey Mandel, Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who gained notoriety for playing in later editions of the band. British blues pioneer John Mayall has frequently found musicians for his band among former Canned Heat members.      **Early lineups**      Canned Heat was started within the community of blues collectors. Bob Hite had been trading blues records since his early teens and his house in Topanga Canyon was a meeting place for people interested in music. In 1965 some blues devotees decided there to form a jug band and started rehearsals. The initial configuration was comprised of Bob Hite as vocalist, Al Wilson on bottleneck guitar, Mike Perlowin on lead guitar, Stu Brotman on bass and Keith Sawyer on drums. Perlowin and Sawyer dropped out within a few days, so guitarist Kenny Edwards (a friend of Alan Wilson) stepped in to replace Perlowin, and Ron Holmes agreed to sit in on drums until they could find a permanent drummer. Another of Bob’s friends, Henry Vestine, asked if he could join the band and was accepted while keeping Edwards on temporarily. Soon Edwards departed (he went on to form the Stone Poneys with Linda Ronstadt) and at same time Frank Cook came in to replace Holmes as their permanent drummer. He already had a substantial professional experience, having performed with such jazz luminaries as bassist Charlie Haden, trumpeter Chet Baker or pianist Elmo Hope and had also collaborated with black soul/pop artists as Shirley Ellis and Dobie Gray",264889,blues,"['album rock', 'blues', 'blues-rock', 'classic rock', 'electric blues', 'folk rock', 'hard rock', 'mellow gold', 'psychedelic rock', 'rock', 'roots rock']",canned heat,59,"['Going Up The Country', 'Canned Heat', 'On The Road Again', ""Let's Work Together - Long Version / Bonus Track"", 'Cristo Redentor - Live', 'Going Up The Country', 'Canned Heat - Remastered', 'On The Road Again', 'Canned Heat', ""Goin' Up The Country""]"
"Lionel Leo Hampton (1908–2002), was a U.S. bandleader, jazz percussionist, and vibraphonist.      Hampton was born on 20th April 1908 in Louisville, Kentucky, but moved to Chicago as a child, where he began his career as a drummer. He relocated to Los Angeles to play drums in [Les Hite](http://www.last.fm/music/Les+Hite)’s band. They soon became the house band for Frank Sebastian’s New Cotton Club, a popular L.A. jazz club.      During a 1930 recording date in the NBC studios in L.A., [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong) discovered a vibraphone. He asked Hampton if he could play it. Hampton, who knew how to play the xylophone, tried it and they agreed to record a few records with Hamp on vibes. Hampton is credited with popularizing the vibraphone as a jazz instrument.      In the mid-1930s, the [Benny Goodman Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Benny+Goodman+Orchestra) came to Los Angeles to play the Palomar Ballroom. John Hammond brought Goodman to see Hampton play. Goodman asked Hampton to move to New York City and join Goodman, [Teddy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Wilson), and [Gene Krupa](http://www.last.fm/music/Gene+Krupa) who’d already formed a [Benny Goodman](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman) Trio within the large band - to expand into the [Benny Goodman Quartet](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman+Quartet). The Trio and Quartet were among the first racially integrated bands to record and play before wide audiences; they were just as well received at Goodman’s famous 1938 Carnegie Hall concert as was the full Goodman band.      While Hampton worked for Goodman in New York, he recorded with several different small groups known as the Lionel Hampton Orchestra as well as assorted small groups within the Goodman band. In the early 40s he left the Goodman organization to form his own touring band.

"Fats Waller (Thomas Wright Waller, May 21, 1904 – December 15, 1943) was an American jazz pianist, organist, composer, singer, and comedic entertainer. His greatest success came with “[Fats Waller & His Rhythm](http://www.last.fm/music/Fats+Waller+&+His+Rhythm)”.      Thomas Wright Waller was the youngest of four children, born in New York to Adeline Locket Waller and Reverend Edward Martin Waller. He started playing the piano when he was six and graduated to the organ of his father’s church four years later. At the age of fourteen he was playing the organ at Harlem’s Lincoln Theater and within twelve months he had composed his first rag. Waller’s first piano solos (“Muscle Shoals Blues” and “Birmingham Blues”) were recorded in October 1922 when he was 18 years old.   He was the prize pupil, and later friend and colleague, of stride pianist [James P. Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/James+P.+Johnson). Fats Waller was the son of a preacher and learned to play the organ in church with his mother. Overcoming opposition from his clergyman father, Waller became a professional pianist at 15, working in cabarets and theaters. In 1918 he won a talent contest playing Johnson’s “Carolina Shout”, a song he learned from watching a player piano play it.      Waller was one of the most popular performers of his era, finding critical and commercial success in his homeland and in Europe. He was also a prolific songwriter and many songs he wrote or co-wrote are still popular, such as “Honeysuckle Rose”, “Ain’t Misbehavin’” and “Squeeze Me”. Fellow pianist and composer Oscar Levant dubbed Waller “the black Horowitz”. Waller composed many novelty tunes in the 1920s and 1930s and sold them for relatively small sums. When the compositions became hits, other songwriters claimed them as their own. Many standards are alternatively and sometimes controversially attributed to Waller. Waller’s son Maurice wrote in his 1977 biography of his father, that once he was playing “I Can’t Give You Anything but Love, Baby” when he heard his father complaining from upstairs and came down and admonished him never to play that song in his hearing, saying that he had to sell that song when he needed some money. He even made a recording of it in 1938 with Adelaide Hall who, coincidentally, had introduced the song to the world (at Les Ambassadeurs Club in New York in 1928), in which he played the tune but made fun of the lyrics. Likewise, Maurice noted his father’s objections whenever he heard “On the Sunny Side of the Street” played on the radio.   The anonymous sleeve notes on the 1960 RCA (UK) album Handful of Keys state that Waller copyrighted over 400 new songs, many of which co-written with his closest collaborator Andy Razaf. Razaf described his partner as “the soul of melody… a man who made the piano sing… both big in body and in mind… known for his generosity… a bubbling bundle of joy”",65491,jazz,"['adult standards', 'bebop', 'big band', 'dixieland', 'jazz', 'jazz piano', 'ragtime', 'stride', 'swing', 'tin pan alley', 'vocal jazz']",fats waller,48,"[""Ain't Misbehavin'"", ""Ain't Misbehavin'"", ""Ain't Misbehavin'"", ""I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter"", 'Two Sleepy People', 'Honeysuckle Rose', 'Until the Real Thing Comes Along', ""That's Where The South Begins"", ""When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful - Remastered"", 'Sweet & Slow']"
"Jimmy Dorsey (February 29, 1904 – June 12, 1957) was born in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, the son of a music teacher, but overshadowed by his younger brother Tommy Dorsey, the prominent musician. He played trumpet in his youth, appearing on stage in a Vaudeville act as early as 1913.

"**Louis Armstrong** (August 4, 1901 - July 6, 1971) nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.   Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an “inventive” trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly- recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).   Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong’s influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to “cross over”, whose skin-color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African- Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.      Armstrong was born and brought up in New Orleans, a culturally diverse town with a unique musical mix of creole, ragtime, marching bands, and blues. Although from an early age he was able to play music professionally, he didn’t travel far from New Orleans until 1922, when he went to Chicago to join his mentor, [King Oliver](http://www.last.fm/music/King+Oliver). Oliver’s band played primitive jazz, a hotter style of ragtime, with looser rhythms and more improvisation, and Armstrong’s role was mostly backing. Slow to promote himself, he was eventually persuaded by his wife [Lil Hardin](http://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Hardin+Armstrong) to leave Oliver, and In 1924 he went to New York to join the [Fletcher Henderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Fletcher+Henderson) Orchestra. At the time, there were a few other artists using the rhythmic innovations of the New Orleans style, but none did it with the energy and brilliance of Armstrong, and he quickly became a sensation among New York musicians. Back in Chicago in 1925, he made his first recordings with his own group, Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five, and these became not only popular hits but also models for the first generation of jazz musicians, trumpeters or otherwise.      Other hits followed through the twenties and thirties, as well as troubles: crooked managers, lip injuries, mob entanglements, failed big-band ventures. As jazz styles changed, though, musical purists never lost any respect for him — although they were sometimes irritated by his hammy onstage persona",1812312,blues,"['adult standards', 'dixieland', 'jazz trumpet', 'new orleans jazz', 'swing', 'vocal jazz']",louis armstrong,71,"['What A Wonderful World - Single Version', 'La vie en rose - Single Version', 'Dream A Little Dream Of Me - Single Version', 'Summertime', 'A Kiss To Build A Dream On - Single Version', 'Cheek To Cheek', ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"", ""Let's Call The Whole Thing Off"", ""When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You) - Without Intro"", ""Isn't This A Lovely Day?""]"

"Earl Simmons (born December 18, 1970 in Mount Vernon, New York), better known by his stage name DMX (Dark Man X), is an American rapper from Yonkers, New York and actor signed to Ruff Ryders Entertainment. In 1998 he released his debut solo album, It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot, and has since released 1998’s Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, 1999’s …And Then There Was X, 2001’s The Great Depression, 2003’s Grand Champ and 2006’s Year of the Dog…Again. He has plans to release two more albums, Walk with Me Now and the gospel inspired You’ll Fly with Me Later, but his incarceration on drug possession charges had prevented him from doing so until early 2010.      Following the deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., DMX took over as the reigning, undisputed king of hardcore rap. He was that rare commodity: a commercial powerhouse with artistic and street credibility to spare. His rapid ascent to stardom was actually almost a decade in the making, which gave him a chance to develop the theatrical image that made him one of rap’s most distinctive personalities during his heyday. Everything about DMX was unremittingly intense, from his muscular, tattooed physique to his gruff, barking delivery, which made a perfect match for his trademark lyrical obsession with dogs. Plus, there was substance behind the style; much of his work was tied together by a fascination with the split between the sacred and the profane. He could move from spiritual anguish one minute to a narrative about the sins of the streets the next, yet keep it all part of the same complex character, sort of like a hip-hop Johnny Cash. The results were compelling enough to make DMX the first artist ever to have his first five albums enter the charts at number one.      Biography      Earl Simmons was the second of three children of a single mother, and was born in Mount Vernon, New York Simmons ended up growing up in the School Street housing projects of Yonkers, New York. He began rapping around the age of 13, amusing crowds of children with rhymes that relied on spelled-out words, a style he called “spellbound.” A local rapper eventually asked the young Earl to beatbox for him, and Simmons agreed, adopting the stage name DMX, which stands for “Dark Man of the Unknown,” X being an algebraic expression for unknown. But at the time, stood for a drum system that delivered amazing beats. Eventually he decided to try his hand at serious rapping, and honed his skills during a stint at a group home. He also got into fights and frequently was on the run from police. During this period, he also began doing shows and battling other rappers (Once battling and defeating Jay-Z), making a name for himself in the New York area. He released his first album called “DMX: Unleashed and Unreleased” which was an instant hit on the streets of Yonkers.

"Bob Crosby (August 23, 1913 Spokane, Washington – March 9, 1993 La Jolla, California) was an American dixieland bandleader and vocalist, best known for his group Crosby and the Bob-Cats.      He was the youngest of seven children: five boys, Larry (1895-1975), Everett (born 1896), Ted (born 1900), Harry (1903-1977, popularly known as Bing Crosby) and Bob; and two girls, Catherine (born 1905) and Mary Rose (born 1907). His parents were English-American bookkeeper Harry Lowe Crosby (1871-1950) and Irish-American Catherine Harrigan (1873-1964), (affectionately known as Kate), the daughter of a builder from County Mayo in Ireland. His paternal ancestors Thomas Prence and Patience Brewster were born in England and immigrated to the U.S. in the 17th century; Brewster’s family came over on the Mayflower.      Bob Crosby started singing with Anson Weeks (1931-34) and the Dorsey Brothers (1934-35). He led his first band in 1935, when the former members of Ben Pollack’s band elected him as titular leader. His most famous band, the Bob- Cats, was a Dixieland jazz group with members from the Bob Crosby Orchestra. Both the Bob Crosby Orchestra and the smaller Bob-Cats group specialized in Dixieland jazz, presaging the traditional jazz revival of the 1940s. Crosby’s singing voice was remarkably similar to that of his brother Bing, but without its range.      The Bob Crosby Orchestra and the Bob Cats included (at various times) Yank Lawson, Billy Butterfield, Muggsy Spanier, Matty Matlock, Irving Fazola, Ward Silloway, Warren Smith, Eddie Miller, Joe Sullivan, Bob Zurke, Jess Stacy, Nappy Lamare, Bob Haggart, Walt Yoder, Jack Sperling, and Ray Bauduc.      Hits included “Summertime” (theme song), “In a Little Gypsy Tea Room,” “Whispers in The Dark,” “South Rampart Street Parade,” “March of the Bob Cats,” “Day In, Day Out,” “You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby,” “Dolores” and “New San Antonio Rose” (last three with Bing Crosby). A remarkable bass and drums duet between Haggart and Bauduc, “Big Noise From Winnetka,” became a hit in 1938-39.

"Grammy nominated artist and globally acclaimed DJ and Producer Paul van Dyk continues to dominate the electronic music charts and appears at the pinnacle of every Top DJ list across the globe. His fifth original album In Between was released August 2007 and features collaborations with David Byrne and Jessica Sutta.      PvD is renowned as one of the hardest working artists, with sold-out tours that cross each continent, headline spots at every major festival, and a hugely successful recording career. With over 3 million albums sold worldwide, van Dyk travels around the world over 16 times each year to sold out performances internationally. 2007 alone has brought us PvD remixes of Depeche Mode’s “Martyr”, Britney Spears’ „Gimmy more“ and Justin Timberlake’s “What Goes Around… Comes Around”.      PvD received a Grammy nomination in 2005 for Best Dance/Electronic Album for his original album Reflections – this marked the first time NARAS recognized this category. His original productions from Reflections have been synced into major motion pictures such as Into the Blue, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, television’s Entertainment Tonight and MTV’s Cribs, and international ad campaigns for Motorola, HBO, Land Rover, Ski Vail and most recently for Jeep. This year he won the International Dance Music Award (IDMA) for Best Euro DJ.      Previously, PvD won four IDMAs in 2006: Best Global DJ, Best NuNRG/Euro Track, Best Producer and Best Mix Compilation for The Politics of Dancing 2. In addition, PvD was voted “America’s Favorite DJ” for 2004 and 2005 by BPM Magazine and was the big winner at the 2004 Dancestar Awards, taking home 3 awards: Best International DJ, Best Event and Best Music in a Commercial (Motorola). He also won the Mexican Oscar for his soundtrack in the film Zurdo in March 2004. Paul van Dyk was voted “Best Music Maker” by DJ Magazine, received the “Best International DJ Award” at the 1999 Music Awards in London, was named “Best International DJ” by Ministry of Sound Magazine, and Mixmag elected him as “Man of the Year”.      Aside from his musical activity, Paul van Dyk has always dedicated a significant part of his life to politics and social justice: from his youth, when he fled over the Berlin Wall to the West, to his children’s charity in India’s Mumbai, and his partnership scheme with the German Red Cross to help poor children in Berlin. In 2004, PvD was the only electronic artist involved in a nationwide tour with the Rock The Vote campaign, where he joined the likes of Bono, P Diddy, the Black Eyed Peas and George Clinton in campaigning for America’s youth to sign up to vote in the presidential election. In 2006 he received Berlin’s Medal of Honor (Landesverdienstorden) in recognition of his work with Ruckenwind, a charity organization he founded dedicated to helping poor children in Berlin. He joins a distinguished list of arts and political establishment figures with this honor",3049016,electronic,"['edm', 'progressive house', 'progressive trance', 'trance']",paul van dyk,80,"['Galaxy (ASOT 931)', '1998 - Paul van Dyk Remix', 'For An Angel - Radio Edit', ""For an Angel 2009 - Radio Mix '09"", 'Nothing But You (feat.

"Bennett Lester Carter (August 8, 1907 – July 12, 2003) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, trumpeter, composer, arranger, and bandleader. He was a major figure in jazz from the 1930s to the 1990s, and was recognised as such by other jazz musicians who called him King.      As a youth, Carter lived in Harlem around the corner from Bubber Miley who was Duke Ellington’s star trumpeter. Carter was inspired by Miley and bought a trumpet, but when he found he couldn’t play like Miley he traded the trumpet in for a saxophone.      Carter began playing professionally at 15. He first recorded in 1928 and formed his first big band the following year. He played with Fletcher Henderson in 1930 and 1931, then briefly led McKinney’s Cotton Pickers before returning to lead his own band in 1932. The few recordings his band made between 1933 and 1934 are considered by most jazz scholars to be milestones in early swing arranging. They were sophisticated and very complex arrangements, and a number of them became swing standards which were performed by other bands (“Blue Lou” is a great example of this.) He also arranged for Henderson and Duke Ellington during these years and wrote two hits, “Blues in My Heart” and “When Lights are Low.” By the early 1930s he and Johnny Hodges were considered the leading alto players of the day. Carter also quickly became a leading trumpet soloist, having rediscovered the instrument. He recorded extensively on trumpet in the 1930s. Also, in 1933, Carter took part in an amazing series of sessions that featured the British band leader Spike Hughes, who came to New York specifically to organize a series of recordings featuring the best Black musicians available. These 14 sides were only issued in England at that time, though they are available on CD and worthwhile looking for. (The musicians were mainly made up from member of Carter’s band and from Luis Russell’s.)      In 1935 he moved to Europe, where he became staff arranger for the British Broadcasting Corporation dance orchestra and made several records. He returned to the United States in 1938 and led a big band and sextet before moving to Los Angeles in 1943 to write for movie studios. Carter continued writing and performing into his 90s. He arranged for Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, and Sarah Vaughan, among many others.      His biggest hit was “Cow Cow Boogie”, a song he co-wrote with Don Raye and Gene DePaul, which was a hit for Ella Mae Morse in 1942.      In the 1940s and 1950s, Carter was one of the first black men to compose music for films. He was an inspiration and a mentor for Quincy Jones when Jones began writing for television and films in the 1960s. Also in the 1940s, Carter’s successful legal battles in order to obtain housing in then-exclusive neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area made him a pioneer in an entirely different area.      He also appears uncredited in the 1952 film, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, as a sax player",286952,jazz,"['bossa nova', 'brazilian jazz', 'jazz guitar', 'mpb', 'samba']",benny carter,65,"['Only Trust Your Heart', 'Farewell Blues', 'My Blue Heaven', 'Christmas In New Orleans', ""Ain't She Sweet"", 'Farewell Blues', ""Isn't It Romantic"", 'Honeysuckle Rose', 'That Midnight Sun Will Never Set', ""A Walkin' Thing""]"
"Johnny Paycheck (May 31, 1938 – February 18, 2003) was a country music singer. He is most famous for covering the David Allan Coe song “Take This Job And Shove It”.      Born Donald Eugene Lytle in Greenfield, Ohio, he began playing guitar by age 6 and made his first record at age 15. After a time served in the United States Navy (which included a court-martial for assault), he began performing under the name Donny Young. The singer took a job with country music star George Jones, for whom he played bass and steel guitar for several years, co-writing Jones’ hit song, “Once You’ve Had the Best.” By the 1960s, he had changed his name to Johnny Paycheck, a name similar to Johnny Cash, which has sometimes caused confusion.      A member of the Grand Ole Opry, PayCheck is best remembered for his 1977 cover of, “Take This Job and Shove It” (written by David Allan Coe) which sold over 2 million copies and inspired a motion picture of the same name. Colorado Kool-Aid is another of his most famous songs. In his career, PayCheck recorded eleven songs that made it into country music’s top ten chart plus he co-wrote several successful songs for other country singers including “Apartment #9,” a hit for Tammy Wynette.      His life was often filled with turmoil and in 1985, PayCheck was convicted of shooting a man in Hillsboro, Ohio and spent two years in prison. His tax problems with the IRS led to his filing for bankruptcy in 1990. Later in the 1990s, he began capitalizing the fourth letter of his name in a style later dubbed CamelCase, preferring to be known as Johnny PayCheck.      PayCheck suffered from drug and alcohol addiction during his career, although he was said to have “put his life in order” [1] after his prison stay. Suffering from emphysema and asthma, after a lengthy illness, Johnny PayCheck died at Nashville’s Vanderbilt University Medical Center.      He was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville.      He is survived by his wife Sharon PayCheck and son Jonathan PayCheck.

"Deana Kay Carter (born January 4, 1966 in Nashville, Tennessee, USA) is an American singer-songwriter who records country music.      She is the daughter of Fred Carter, Jr. She is known for performing barefoot, saying that it helps her relax enough to sing.         Award-winning singer/songwriter/performer Deana Carter unveils The Chain, her fifth studio record October 9th on Vanguard Records.      Each of the 12 songs on The Chain has a special importance to Deana, who personally chose material that had a great impact on her early life. She took the same care in recruiting collaborators for the project, assembling a group of musicians who influenced her as an artist — none more greatly than her father, legendary session player Fred Carter, Jr, who performs throughout the album. “Ever since I knew that music was going to be my life’s path, I’ve wanted to pay tribute to my dad and to the artists who were so good to me and my family. The camaraderie between them, and the way they took our family and made it part of their families, was so unique that I wanted to recapture it for a little while,” states Deana.      The Chain features duets with Deana and some of country music’s royalty: Kris Kristofferson (Help Me Make It Through The Night), Dolly Parton (Love Is Like A Butterfly), Jessi Colter (I’m Not Lisa), Willie Nelson (On The Road Again), George Jones (He Thinks I Still Care) and John Anderson (Swingin’). The CD also includes two of music’s rising stars, Shooter Jennings on “Good Hearted Woman”, the song made famous by his father, the great Waylon Jennings, and Harper Simon on “The Boxer,” a nod to his dad, Paul Simon who plays guitar on this track. The Chain also features stunning solo recordings of Deana performing such classics as “Lay Lady Lay”, “The Weight”, “Crying” and “Old Man”.      Produced and arranged by Deana Carter, The Chain is a musical feast and celebration of one’s past and influences.   A multi-platinum recording artist, Deana Carter burst into the music scene with the blockbuster album Did I Shave My Legs for This? (1996) that produced four No. 1 hit singles. Her additional releases included Everything’s Gonna Be Alright, Father Christmas, I’m Just A Girl, Greatest Hits and The Story Of My Life. She has performed on countless television shows and network specials and yielded a Golden Globe and Grammy nomination for the song Once Upon A December from the animated film Anastasia.   Deana is based in Los Angeles where she resides with her son, Gray Hayes. She is a spokesperson for the National Kidney Foundation.

"James Travis “Jim” Reeves (August 20, 1923 – July 31, 1964) was an American country and popular music singer-songwriter. With records charting from the 1950s to the 1980s, he became well known as a practitioner of the Nashville sound (a mixture of older country-style music with elements of popular music). Reeves scored his greatest success with the Joe Allison composition “He’ll Have to Go”. Known as “Gentleman Jim”, his songs continued to chart for years after his death. Reeves died at age 40 in the crash of a private airplane. He is a member of both the Country Music and Texas Country Music Halls of Fame.      Reeves was born in Galloway, Texas, a small rural community near Carthage. Winning an athletic scholarship to the University of Texas, he enrolled to study speech and drama, but quit after only six weeks to work in the shipyards in Houston. Soon he resumed baseball, playing in the semi-professional leagues before contracting with the St. Louis Cardinals “farm” team during 1944 as a right-handed pitcher. He played for the minor leagues for three years before severing his sciatic nerve while pitching, which ended his athletic career.      Reeves began to work as a radio announcer, and sang live between songs. During the late 1940s, he was contracted with a couple of small Texas-based recording companies, but without success. Influenced by such Western swing-music artists as Jimmie Rodgers and Moon Mullican, as well as popular singers Bing Crosby, Eddy Arnold and Frank Sinatra, it was not long before he was a member of Moon Mullican’s band, and made some early Mullican-style recordings like “Each Beat of my Heart” and “My Heart’s Like a Welcome Mat” from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.   He eventually obtained a job as an announcer for KWKH-AM in Shreveport, Louisiana, home of the popular former radio program, the Louisiana Hayride. According to former Hayride master of ceremonies Frank Page, who had introduced Elvis Presley on the program in 1954, singer Sleepy LaBeef was late for a performance, and Reeves was asked to substitute. (Other accounts—-including Reeves himself, in an interview on the RCA album Yours Sincerely—-name Hank Williams as the absentee.)      Reeves’ first successful country music songs included “I Love You” (a duet with Ginny Wright), “Mexican Joe”, and “Bimbo” which reached Number 1 in 1954 on the U.S. Country Charts, and other songs with both Fabor Records and Abbott Records. Abbott released his first album in November 1955, Jim Reeves Sings (Abbott 5001), which was the label’s only album release. Earlier in 1955, he was signed to a 10-year recording contract with RCA Victor by Steve Sholes, who produced some of Reeves’ first recordings at RCA and signed Elvis Presley for the company that same year. Also in 1955, he joined the Grand Ole Opry and made his first appearance on ABC-TV’s Ozark Jubilee, where he was a fill-in host from May–July 1958",162567,country,"['adult standards', 'country gospel', 'cowboy western', 'nashville sound', 'rock-and-roll', 'rockabilly', 'traditional country']",jim reeves,56,"[""He'll Have to Go"", 'Welcome to My World', 'Welcome to My World', ""He'll Have to Go"", 'I Love You Because', 'Snowflake', 'Am I Losing You', ""I'd Rather Have Jesus"", 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord', 'Four Walls']"
"**Dixie Chicks** is an American country music trio which has also crossed over into other genres. Formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, the band is composed of founding members (and sisters) Martie Erwin Maguire and Emily Erwin Robison, and lead singer Natalie Maines. The trio is currently ranked as the highest-selling female musical group in the USA, according to RIAA Gold & Platinum album certifications. As of 2012, the Dixie Chicks had won 13 Grammy Awards. While Dixie Chicks continues, Maguire and Robison are writing and recording as [Court Yard Hounds](http://www.last.fm/music/Court+Yard+Hounds) as of Feb 2010.      Robin Lynn Macy was an original bandmember, as was Laura Lynch . Macy left the group in 1992, while Lynch was replaced by Natalie Maines in 1995.      The group aroused considerable controversy for publicly denouncing President George W. Bush and the imminent invasion of Iraq during the European leg of their Top of the World tour supporting _Home_. Many country music stations immediately pulled their music from the air, and the band received criticism from many corners of the media.      Dixie Chicks released their latest album _Taking the Long Way_ on May 23, 2006. All fourteen tracks were co-written by the Dixie Chicks and produced by Rick Rubin. This album received five Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group for “Not Ready to Make Nice,” and Album of the Year and Best Country Album. Rick Rubin also won the Grammy for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, for his work with the Chicks and for his production on Red Hot Chili Peppers’ _Stadium Arcadium_.

"Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier, February 4, 1948) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and musician whose career spans five decades. With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors, and baby dolls, he is considered by fans and peers alike to be “The Godfather of Shock Rock”; Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and macabre brand of rock designed to shock.      Originating in Phoenix in the late 1960s after Furnier moved from Detroit, Alice Cooper was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. The original Alice Cooper band broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit “I’m Eighteen” from the album Love It to Death, which was followed by the even bigger single “School’s Out” in 1972 which reached No 1 in the UK. The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies.      Furnier adopted the band’s name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare. In 2011 he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare, his 19th album as a solo artist, and his 26th album in total. Expanding from his Detroit rock roots, in his career Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, including conceptual rock, art rock, hard rock, heavy metal, new wave, pop rock, experimental rock and industrial rock.

"Lovely, sweet, pure, tuneful, atmospheric DnB and another gem from the good looking stable. Seba hails from Sweden and growing up at a time when jungle wasn’t at all popular in his country he still managed to find his passion in the new exciting UK sounds. So like many of others he got two turntables and a mixer and taught himself to mix. The next step for many DJs is production and Seba was no exception and started to produce the music he is so passionate about. In 1995 LTJ Bukem heard Seba play and the last track of the set “Sonic Winds” immediately caught his attention. It was later released as the fifth ever release on the then newly started Looking Good Records.

The band enjoyed major popularity throughout the [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s), making [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) anthems such as “[Dream On](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith/_/Dream+On)” and “[Sweet Emotion](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith/_/Sweet+Emotion)”, but they split from 1979-84 due to serious in-group arguments and substance abuse problems that contributed to their decline.      Producing a wide variety of tunes influenced both by the [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s) [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) legends as well as the bombastic [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues) artists that the band loved, Joe Perry and Steven Tyler became known as the “toxic twins” due to their rambunctious live performances and nasty lifestyles. The [Grateful Dead](http://www.last.fm/music/Grateful+Dead)’s [Jerry Garcia](http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Garcia) reportedly said Aerosmith featured “the druggiest bunch of guys I’ve ever seen.” Classics from their early area with much airplay also include 1974’s “[Same Old Song and Dance](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith/_/Same+Old+Song+and+Dance)” and 1976’s “[Back in the Saddle](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith/_/Back+in+the+Saddle)”, with 1973’s “[Dream On](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith/_/Dream+On)” being a concert favorite.      Jimmy Crespo replaced Joe Perry for about five years as the band’s fortunes failed. However, in 1984, chiefly due to the tireless efforts of [Joe Perry](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Perry)’s then manager, Tim Collins, to reform the band, Aerosmith was born again. Despite his own client Perry’s insistence that it was unthinkable, Collins succeeded in helping the band resolve old differences and ultimately overcome their addictions. By 1989, the band had completely stopped their drug abuse. During this time, they enjoyed a resurgence in popularity that has endured since and has made them one of top- selling and most popular [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) bands in the world today. Part of that renewal came in the form of a 1986 collaboration with [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) stars [Run- D.M.C.](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Run-+D.M.C.) on a new [rap rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap%20rock) version of [Walk This Way](http://www.last.fm/music/Run-D.M.C./_/Walk+This+Way)",7170158,world,"['album rock', 'classic rock', 'hard rock', 'rock']",aerosmith,79,"['Dream On', 'Sweet Emotion', 'Walk This Way', 'Dude (Looks Like A Lady)', 'I Don\'t Want to Miss a Thing - From ""Armageddon"" Soundtrack', 'Walk This Way (feat.

"**Squarepusher** is a pseudonym of Chelmsford, Essex, England, [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) musician **[Tom Jenkinson](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jenkinson)** (b. 1975), best known for his experimental [drum and bass](http://www.last.fm/tag/drum%20and%20bass), with a heavy [jazz fusion](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion) influence. A skilled bassist and multi-instrumentalist, **Jenkinson**’s virtuoso playing is a staple of his music and one of the more obvious affiliations with jazz (although his formal arrangements are often as jazz-derived as his playing). His bass style includes melodic fretless playing, high-speed slap bass and intricate chordal work. The project débuted with **_[Conumber E:P](http://www.last.fm/music/Squarepusher/Conumber+E:P)_** (1995, [Spymania](http://www.last.fm/label/Spymania)) and the latest is **_[Ufabulum](http://www.last.fm/music/Squarepusher/Ufabulum)_** (May 2012, [Warp](http://www.last.fm/label/Warp)).

"Van Halen is a [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) band which formed in 1972 in Pasadena, California, United States. The band was originally called [Mammoth](http://www.last.fm/music/Mammoth) and changed their name to Van Halen by 1974. The band’s first studio album, “[Van Halen](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Halen/Van+Halen)”, released in 1978, is widely regarded as a milestone in rock music. With this first release, the band, featuring [David Lee Roth](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Lee+Roth) on vocals, [Michael Anthony](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Anthony) on bass, and Dutch-born [Edward Van Halen](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Edward+Van+Halen) on guitars (and also keyboards later) and brother [Alex Van Halen](http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Van+Halen) on drums, established itself as a leader in the emerging and commercially successful U.S. [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal) music genre of the 1980s. In particular, [Eddie Van Halen](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddie+Van+Halen) quickly gained widespread notoriety for his technical prowess and musical sensibility. Almost overnight, he was touted as one of the most innovative and influential American rock and roll guitarists.      From 1978 to 1998 the band released 11 studio albums (with David Lee Roth until 1984, [Sammy Hagar](http://www.last.fm/music/Sammy+Hagar) from 1986 to 1995 and [Gary Cherone](http://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Cherone) from 1998 to 1999), all of which broke the Top 20 spot of the Billboard 200 music charts. Their biggest hit, “[Jump](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Halen/_/Jump)”, reached #1 in the United States and Canada in 1984 . The band has sold more than 75 million albums worldwide and has received several Grammy nominations, winning the award with their 1991 album “[For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Halen/For+Unlawful+Carnal+Knowledge)”. The video for “[Right Now](http://www.last.fm/music/Van+Halen/_/Right+Now)” also received several awards, including MTV’s Best Video award. Van Halen is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records with the most number one hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock List. According to the Recording Industry Association of America Van Halen is #19 on the list of Top Selling Artists of all time (having sold more than 56 million albums in the U.S.). Van Halen is one of five rock groups that have had 2 albums sell more than 10 million albums in the U.S. (the others being: [Led Zeppelin](http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin), [Pink Floyd](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd), [The Eagles](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Eagles) and [Def Leppard](http://www.last.fm/music/Def+Leppard)).

"Faron Young (February 25, 1932, near Shreveport, Louisiana – December 10, 1996), was an American country music singer, predominantly in the honky tonk genre.      Starting off singing at the local Optimist Club, Young was discovered by Webb Pierce, who brought him to star on the Louisiana Hayride radio program on KWKH in 1951.      He was drafted into the Army in late 1952, just after he was signed to Capitol Records. Nicknamed “The Hillbilly Heartthrob” and “The Singing Sheriff,” he had many hits including:      “Young Love”   “If You Ain’t Lovin’ (You Ain’t Livin’)”   “Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young”   “Sweet Dreams”   “Alone With You”   “Hello Walls” (written by Willie Nelson)   “It’s Four in the Morning” (written by Jerry Chesnut).   “Here I Am In Dallas”   “I’ve Got Five Dollars and It’s Saturday Night”   Young made several appearances during the late 1950s on ABC-TV’s Ozark Jubilee.      His #1 country hit “It’s Four in the Morning” was written at his request as he was recuperating from a serious automobile accident in which he suffered head injuries. His tongue had been partly severed in the accident, and it took him several months before he could regain normal speaking ability. He had particular trouble with the “s” sound in most words, so he asked for a song which largely avoided that sound as his comeback effort.      Faron Young’s band, the Country Deputies, was one of country music’s top bands, and toured with him for many years.      Young co-founded, with Preston Temple, the Nashville trade newspaper, The Music City News.      Young died at the age of sixty-four of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had been in failing health when he took his own life.      Legacy and influence   A performance video clip of “It’s Four In The Morning” was the first video to air on CMT when it first launched on March 5, 1983.   In 1985, the country singer inspired homage from British rock group, Prefab Sprout, whose multimillion-selling album, “Steve McQueen” contains the song “Faron Young.” The song has the refrain: You give me Faron Young four in the morning / Forgive me Faron Young four in the morning…”   In 2000, he was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame      In the comic strip Peanuts, Frieda’s cat was named “Faron” after Faron Young, of whom Charles Schulz was a fan.      Worked with Webb Pierce on the Louisana Hayride in 1951. First recorded with Tillman Franks & his Rainbow boys in 1951. Went solo in 1952. Appeared in the 1956 movie “Hidden Guns” and got his nickame “The Young Sheriff”, and his band name, “Country Deputies” from that movie. Also appeared in the movies, Stampede, Daniel Boone, Raiders Of Old California, and That’s Country. Founder and one-time publisher of the Music City News in Nashville. First charted song “Going Steady went to #2 on the Country Charts in 1953. Put 79 songs into the top 40 of the country charts from 1953-1978. Had 5 #1s.

"There are at least two artists by this name:      (1) A country singer and songwriter from Texas.   (2) An alias of techno producer Thomas Wendel.         (1) Born May 27, 1939, in Floydada, Texas, Don Williams spent much of his childhood in Corpus Christi, Texas. His father was a mechanic whose job took him to other regions, his mother played guitar and he grew up listening to country music. He and Lofton Kline formed a semi-professional folk group called the Strangers Two, and then, with the addition of Susan Taylor, they became the Pozo-Seco Singers, the phrase being a geological term to denote a dry well. Handled by Bob Dylan’s manager Albert Grossman, they had major pop hits in the U.S. with “Time,” “I Can Make It With You” and “Look What You’ve Done.” Following Kline’s departure, they employed several replacements, resulting in a lack of musical direction. After Williams had failed to turn the trio towards country music, they disbanded in 1971.      He then worked for his father-in-law but also wrote for Susan Taylor’s solo album via Jack Clement’s music publishing company. Clement asked Williams to record albums of his company’s best songs, mainly with a view to attracting other performers. In 1973, Don Williams, Volume 1 was released on the fledgling JMI label and included such memorable songs as Bob McDill’s apologia for growing old, “Amanda,” and Williams’ own “The Shelter of Your Eye.” Williams’ work was reissued by Dot Records, and Don Williams, Volume 2 included “Atta Way to Go” and “We Should Be Together.” Williams then had a country No. 1 with Wayland Holyfield’s “You’re My Best Friend,” which has become a standard and is the perennial sing-along anthem at his concerts. By now, the Williams’ style had developed: gently paced love songs with straightforward arrangements, lyrics and sentiments. Williams was mining the same vein as Jim Reeves, but he eschewed Reeves’ smartness by dressing like a ranch-hand. Besides having a huge contingent of female fans, Williams counted Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend among his admirers. Clapton recorded his country hit “Tulsa Time,” written by Danny Flowers, a member of Williams’ band.      Williams played a band member himself in the Burt Reynolds film W.W. & the Dixie Dance Kings and also appeared in Smokey and the Bandit 2. Williams’ other successes include “Till the Rivers All Run Dry,” “Some Broken Hearts Never Mend,” “Lay Down Beside Me” and his only U.S. solo pop hit, “I Believe in You.” Unlike most established country artists, he has not sought duet partners, although he and Emmylou Harris found success in 1981 with their version of Townes Van Zandt’s “If I Needed You.” Among the highlights of Williams’ recording career is his interpretation of “Good Ol’ Boys Like Me,” McDill’s homage to his southern roots. Moving to Capitol Records in the mid-’80s, Williams released such singles as “Heartbeat in the Darkness” and “Senorita,” but the material was not as impressive",233289,country,"['country', 'country gospel', 'country rock', 'cowboy western', 'nashville sound', 'outlaw country', 'traditional country']",don williams,59,"['Tulsa Time', 'Lord, I Hope This Day Is Good - Single Version', 'I Believe In You', 'Tulsa Time', 'I Believe In You', 'Good Ole Boys Like Me - Single Version', 'It Must Be Love', 'Ballad Of Hank Williams', 'It Must Be Love - Single Version', 'Amanda (feat.

"**The Bellamy Brothers** started their musical career at the end of the 1960s. In 1968, they had their first official gig, playing a free show with their father at the Rattlesnake Roundup in San Antonio, Florida, USA. They kept playing throughout the South, often with already recognized musicians, such as Percy Sledge, Eddie Floyd and others. A couple of months later, the brothers moved up north, discovering the potentials of rock/country music in Atlanta, Georgia.      During the long road gigs, David Bellamy discovered that he had a talent for songwriting. It was his lyrics that eventually made it possible for the duo to become an international act. This breakout came eventually in form of the hit “Spiders and Snakes,” which sold more than three million units and brought the Bellamy Brothers to L.A. music scene.      The duo was very well-known at the time; however, they were not yet famous internationally. That all changed with the crossover single “Let Your Love Flow” in 1976, the song becoming instant smash worldwide. It remained on charts long enough to build an appreciable international fan base, which exists to this date. For example, in Germany the song stayed a number one hit for two months.      Their music gradually became more and more country-like. By the late ’70s, another hit followed: “If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body (Would You Hold It Against Me)”. Just like “Let Your Love Flow” put them on pop charts a few years earlier, this song did just the same with the country charts.      During the early to mid 1980s, the Bellamy Brothers were among the most dominant duos in country music. In that span, they scored eight No. 1 singles on the Billboard magazine country singles chart, including “Sugar Daddy” and “Dancin’ Cowboys” (1980); “Do You Love as Good as You Look” (1981); “For All the Wrong Reasons” and “Redneck Girl” (1982); “When I’m Away From You” (1983); “I Need More of You” (1985); and “Kids of the Baby Boom” (1987). They also shared a No. 1 duet with the Forester Sisters with 1986’s “Too Much is Not Enough.”      Other important hits in the Bellamys’ discography were “You Ain’t Just Whistlin’ Dixie” (1979); “Lovers Live Longer” (1980); “You’re My Favorite Star” (1981); “Reggae Cowboy” (1982); “Strong Weakness” and “I Love Her Mind” (1983); “Forget About Me” and “World’s Greatest Lover” (1984); “Old Hippie” and “Lie to You For Your Love” (1985); “Feelin’ the Feelin’” (1986); “Crazy From the Heart” (1987); “Santa Fe” and “Rebels Without a Clue” (1988); “Big Love” and “You’ll Never Be Sorry” (1989); “I Could Be Persuaded” (1990); and “Cowboy Beat” (1992).      The Bellamy Brothers hold the record in both the Academy of Country Music (ACM) and Country Music Association Awards (CMA) for most duo nominations. Throughout their career, they have released at least two dozen hit songs outside the U.S. that were never released in the United States.

"**Huddie Ledbetter** (January 20, 1888 - December 6, 1949) was an iconic American folk and blues musician, and multi-instrumentalist, notable for his strong vocals, his virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the songbook of folk standards he introduced.      Although Lead Belly most commonly played the twelve-string, he could also play the piano, mandolin, harmonica, violin, and accordion. In some of his recordings, such as in one of his versions of the folk ballad “John Hardy”, he performs on the accordion instead of the guitar. In other recordings he just sings while clapping his hands or stomping his foot.   The topics of Lead Belly’s music covered a wide range of subjects, including gospel songs; blues songs about women, liquor, prison life, and racism; and folk songs about cowboys, prison, work, sailors, cattle herding, and dancing. He also wrote songs concerning the newsmakers of the day, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Jean Harlow, the Scottsboro Boys, and Howard Hughes.   In 2008, Lead Belly was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.      Though many of his posthumous releases list him as “Leadbelly,” he himself spelled it “**[Lead Belly](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Lead+Belly)**.” This is also the usage on most of his original records, tombstone, as well as of the [Lead Belly Foundation](http://www.leadbelly.org/).      **Leadbelly** was born in Mooringsport, Louisiana, and spent time in and out of prison most of his life. In 1933, serving a sentence for attempted murder, musicologists John and Alan Lomax “discovered” him on a field recording tour sponsored by the Library of Congress. That summer, he was pardoned by the governor of Lousiana after recording his plea for pardon on a record, together with “[Good Night Irene](http://www.last.fm/music/Leadbelly/_/Good+Night+Irene)”. **Leadbelly** went on to make hundreds of recordings of all sorts of different songs: country, blues, spirituals, reels, and work chants.

"Coleman Randolph Hawkins (November 21, 1904 – May 19, 1969), nicknamed Hawk and sometimes “Bean”, was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. While Hawkins is strongly associated with the swing music and big band era, he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s.   Fellow saxophonist Lester Young, known as “Pres”, commented in a 1959 interview with The Jazz Review: “As far as I’m concerned, I think Coleman Hawkins was the President first, right? As far as myself, I think I’m the second one.” Miles Davis once said: “When I heard Hawk, I learned to play ballads.”   One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument, as Joachim E. Berendt explained: “there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn”.      Hawkins was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri, in 1904. Although some sources say 1901, there is no evidence to prove an earlier date; instead, there is record of Hawkins’s parents’ first child, a girl, being born in 1901 and dying at the age of two, possibly basis for the mistaken belief. He was named Coleman after his mother Cordelia’s maiden name.   He attended high school in Chicago, then in Topeka, Kansas at Topeka High School. He later stated that he studied harmony and composition for two years at Washburn College in Topeka while still attending high school. In his youth he played piano and cello, and started playing saxophone at the age of nine; by the age of fourteen he was playing around eastern Kansas.   Hawkins’s first major gig was with Mamie Smith’s Jazz Hounds in 1921, and he was with the band full time from April 1922 to 1923, when he settled in New York City. In the Jazz Hounds, he coincided with Garvin Bushell, Everett Robbins, Bubber Miley and Herb Flemming, among others. Hawkins joined Fletcher Henderson’s Orchestra, where he remained until 1934, sometimes doubling on clarinet and bass saxophone. Hawkins’s playing changed significantly during Louis Armstrong’s tenure with the Henderson Orchestra (1924–25). In the late 1920s, Hawkins also participated in some of the earliest interracial recording sessions with the Mound City Blue Blowers. During his time with Henderson, he became a star soloist with an increasing amount of solos space on records. While with the band, he and Henry “Red” Allen recorded a series of small group sides for ARC (on their Perfect, Melotone, Romeo, and Oriole labels). Hawkins also recorded a number of solo recordings, with either piano or with a pick-up band of Henderson’s musicians in 1933–34, just prior to his period in Europe. He was also featured on a Benny Goodman session on February 2, 1934 for Columbia, which also featured Mildred Bailey as guest vocalist.   In late 1934, Hawkins accepted an invitation to play with Jack Hylton’s orchestra in London, and toured Europe as a soloist until 1939, performing and recording with Django Reinhardt and Benny Carter in Paris in 1937",75806,jazz,"['bebop', 'big band', 'contemporary post-bop', 'cool jazz', 'hard bop', 'jazz', 'jazz saxophone', 'soul jazz', 'stride', 'swing', 'vocal jazz']",coleman hawkins,49,"['Rosita', 'Out Of Nowhere', 'Greensleeves', 'What a difference a day makes', 'Body and Soul', 'Cocktails For Two', ""You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To"", ""You'd Be So Nice to Come Home to"", 'Sweet Loraine', 'Prisoner Of Love']"
"**The Beatles** were an iconic rock group from Liverpool, England. They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the 1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.      After conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical ‘British Invasion’ into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.      Early on, the band consisted of [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison), [John Lennon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon), [Paul McCartney](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney), [Stuart Sutcliffe](http://www.last.fm/music/Stuart+Sutcliffe), and [Pete Best](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Best). The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group’s 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage.      In 1961, [Brian Epstein](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Epstein) heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous experience in that field. After Decca Records rejected the band with the famous comment “guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein”, his efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer [George Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Martin), who signed them to EMI’s Parlaphone label.      Later, due in part to Martin’s refusal to use him on recordings, [Pete Best](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Best) was replaced by [Ringo Starr](http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr), the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as [Rory Storm](http://www.last.fm/music/Rory+Storm) and the [Hurricanes](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Hurricanes). Ringo was supposed to play on their first single, “[Love Me Do](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Love+Me+Do)”, but [George Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Martin) had [Alan White](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+White), a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song)",13410416,rock,"['british invasion', 'merseybeat', 'psychedelic rock', 'rock']",the beatles,88,"['Here Comes The Sun - Remastered 2009', 'Come Together - Remastered 2009', 'Hey Jude - Remastered 2015', 'Let It Be - Remastered 2009', 'Yesterday - Remastered 2009', 'I Want To Hold Your Hand - Remastered 2015', 'Twist And Shout - Remastered 2009', 'Blackbird - Remastered 2009', 'In My Life - Remastered 2009', 'Something - Remastered 2009']"
"Memphis Slim (3 September, 1915 in Memphis, Tennessee – 24 February, 1988 in Paris, [France](http://www.last.fm/place/France)) was a [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) pianist and singer. His birth name was John Len Chatman although he himself claimed to be born Peter Chatman (the name he gave himself in honour of his father Peter Chatman Sr. when he first recorded for Okeh in 1940). He composed the blues standards “Every Day I Have the Blues” and “Mother Earth”. Memphis Slim got his start playing the blues at the Midway Café, at 357 Beale Street (southeast corner of Fourth and Beale Streets) in Memphis in 1931. Two years before his death, Memphis Slim was named a Commander in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of France.

"**Barenaked Ladies** (often abbreviated BNL) is a [Canadian](http://www.last.fm/tag/canadian) [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band currently composed of [Jim Creeggan](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Creeggan), [Kevin Hearn](http://www.last.fm/music/Kevin+Hearn), [Ed Robertson](http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Robertson), and [Tyler Stewart](http://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Stewart), and formerly [Andy Creeggan](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Creeggan) and [Steven Page](http://www.last.fm/music/Steven+Page). Page left the band amicably in February 2009 to pursue solo projects. March 7th, 2009 saw their first show on stage as a foursome in Orlando Florida. Tyler Stewart’s drumset was proudly emblazoned with a “Fantastic 4” logo. In March 2010, they released [All In Good Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/All+In+Good+Time), their first post-Page studio album.      They formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, and are best known for their hit singles, “[One Week](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/One+Week)”, “[Pinch Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Pinch+Me)”, “[If I Had $100000 0](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Barenaked+Ladies/_/If+I+Had+00000)” and “[Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Brian+Wilson)”, and for their light-hearted and comedic performance style. Their trademark at live shows is humorous banter between songs, and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at almost every concert they perform. Each member of the group is a versatile musician, as there are a lot of varied instruments, and each member (with the exception of drummer Tyler Stewart) has written and sung lead on at least one song for the band.      **Indie origins**      Barenaked Ladies began as the duo of Ed Robertson and Steven Page. The two had gone to school together since Robertson was in the fourth grade (Page was a grade ahead), but were not friends until they ran into each other at a Harvey’s restaurant following a [Peter Gabriel](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel) concert. Each interested to find the other liked Gabriel, they began talking and found they had many of the same tastes. The two became friends, and when Page had an extra ticket to a [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan) concert that no one wanted, he ran into Robertson at a party. The two attended the concert at Exhibition Stadium (most likely on August 29, 1988). It was a period where Dylan’s band was led by [G.E. Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/G.E.+Smith), and Robertson describes the show as “horrible” and “lame”. The two turned to amusing each other, pretending they were [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) critics, inventing histories and comments about the Dylan band.

"**R.E.M.** were an [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1980. The band originally consisted of [Michael Stipe](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Stipe) (vocals), [Peter Buck](http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Buck) (guitar, mandolin), [Mike Mills](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Mills) (bass, keyboards, vocals) and [Bill Berry](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Berry) (drums, vocals). Berry retired from the band in October 1997 after having suffered a brain aneurysm in 1995.      R.E.M. released its first single, ” [Radio Free Europe](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/Radio+Free+Europe) “, in 1981 on the independent record label [Hib-Tone](http://www.last.fm/label/Hib-Tone). The single was followed by the [Chronic Town EP](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Chronic+Town+EP) in 1982, the band’s first release on [I.R.S. Records](http://www.last.fm/label/I.R.S.+Records). In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, [Murmur](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Murmur) , and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single “[The One I Love](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./_/The+One+I+Love) “. The group signed to [Warner Bros.](http://www.last.fm/label/Warner+Bros.) in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.      By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, [Out of Time](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Out+of+Time) (1991) and [Automatic for the People](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Automatic+for+the+People) (1992), which veered from the band’s established sound. R.E.M.’s 1994 release, [Monster](http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M./Monster) , was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a three-piece. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.      On 21 September 2011, after over 30 years together, R.E.M. announced that they had split up.

"Stanley Newcomb Kenton (December 15, 1911 August 25, 1979) led a highly innovative, influential, and often controversial American jazz orchestra. In later years he was widely active as an educator.      Origins      Stan Kenton was born in Wichita, Kansas, and raised first in Colorado and then in California. He learned piano as a child, and while still a teenager toured with various bands. In June 1941 he formed his own band, which developed into one of the best-known West Coast ensembles of the Forties.      Music      Kenton’s musical aggregations were decidedly “orchestras.” Sometimes consisting of two dozen or more musicians at once, they produced an unmistakable Kenton sound—as recognizable as that of the bands of Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, or Count Basie. So large an orchestra was able to produce a tremendous, at times overpowering, volume in the dance and concert halls of the land; among musical conservatives it developed a reputation for playing strange-sounding pieces much too loudly, and indeed one comical MC introduced Stan Kenton as “Cant Standit.”      A Kenton specialty was Afro-Cuban rhythm, as exported to North America by such bandleaders as Machito (whose brass and reed sound, in turn, began to show the influence of Kenton). Translated into the Kenton idiom, however, the Latin rhythms might be scored for a full panoply of percussion instruments: tympani, bongos, conga, timbales, claves, and maracas. This component of Kenton’s work may be heard on the 1947 recording “Machito” and on the album Cuban Fire, still in print after more than fifty years of ceaseless change in popular music.      Many of Kenton’s band arrangements were written by Kenton himself, as well as other composers and arrangers such as Gene Roland, Pete Rugolo, W. A. Mathieu, Johnny Richards, Lennie Niehaus, Gerry Mulligan, Hank Levy, Bill Russo, Dee Barton, Bill Holman, Shorty Rogers, Ken Hanna, and Bob Graettinger (ref. his formidable but fascinating “City of Glass”). The music, which could be intensely dissonant, made use of powerful brass sections and unconventional saxophone voicings that showed Kenton’s love of experimenting, reflected in the names he gave his ensembles: “Innovations Orchestra,” “Neophonic Orchestra,” and “Mellophonium Orchestra.” Kenton’s theme song from the early days to the last was called, significantly, “Artistry in Rhythm.” It was owing in part to Kenton’s ambitious musical nomenclature that many critics dismissed his work as mannered and pretentious. But apart from recording a few dance- band albums (Kenton’s men could play standards beautifully), he avoided compromising his idea of jazz to please either critics or public.      Career      Kenton played in the 1930s in the dance bands of Vido Musso and Gus Arnheim, but he was born to be a leader. In 1941 he formed his first orchestra, which later was named after his theme song “Artistry in Rhythm",13350,brass,"['big band', 'cool jazz', 'swing']",stan kenton,33,"['Malaguena', 'Tampico', 'Orange Colored Sky - Remastered 2005', 'Orange Colored Sky - 2003 Digital Remaster', 'Thermopolae', 'Decoupage', ""Say It Isn't So"", 'The Peanut Vendor - 1956 Version', 'Send In The Clowns', 'Time For A Change']"
"Formed around 1990 in Los Angeles, California, United States, by drummer [Danny Carey](http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Carey), guitarist [Adam Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Jones), vocalist [Maynard James Keenan](http://www.last.fm/music/Maynard+James+Keenan), and original bassist [Paul d’Amour](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+d%27Amour), Tool is a band that is most noted for combining alternative metal with a wide variety of progressive structures, irregular time signatures and lyrics that range from angry diatribes to meditations on philosophical and social matters.      After performing a handful of shows in the Los Angeles area and up the West Coast, they toured in the United States with [Primus](http://www.last.fm/music/Primus) in the summer of 1992 in support of their EP [Opiate](http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/Opiate). Their first full length recording, [Undertow](http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/Undertow), was released in 1993.      Emerging with a groovy heavy [industrial](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial) sound on their first release, when the genre was dominated by post-punk, they were later seen at the top of the industrial [metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal) movement with the release of their second full-length studio album [Ænima](http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/%C3%86nima) in 1996, the first recording the band made after original bassist Paul D’Amour left the band, replaced by [Justin Chancellor](http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Chancellor). After an ongoing evolution of their sound and continuous efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution on [Lateralus](http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/Lateralus) (2001), their most recent album [10,000 Days](http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/10,000+Days) (2006), as well as respective tours, they are generally described as a style-transgressing act and part of [progressive](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive) and [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock).      Their aspirational work features exceptionally long or complex releases, controversial lyrics and cover art, and unorthodox music videos, which results in a rather ambivalent relationship between the band and today’s music industry, at times marked by censorship, and the band’s ongoing struggle for privacy.      Nevertheless, Tool has won Grammy Awards and continues to perform worldwide and receive critical acclaim. Lateralus and 10,000 Days both debuted number one on the US Billboard 200 as well as topping the charts in numerous other countries. Between album releases, the band takes extended breaks that allow for collaboration with other artists in designing award-winning album packaging, the creation of elaborate light shows, and band member involvement in notable side-projects.

"Alfonzo “Lonnie” Johnson (February 8, 1894 – June 6, 1970) was a pioneering blues and jazz singer/guitarist born in New Orleans, Louisiana. There is some dispute over the year of his birth, but 1894 is what appears on his passport. He was a pioneer of jazz guitar as the first to play single-string guitar solos. [citation needed] Raised in a family of musicians, Johnson studied violin and guitar as a child, but concentrated on the latter throughout his professional career. A 1917 tour to England with a revue may have saved his life, for he returned to New Orleans in 1919 to find that most of his family had died in the 1918 influenza epidemic.      In the early 1920s, Johnson worked with the orchestras of Charlie Creath and Fate Marable on riverboats, but he made St. Louis his home in 1925. There he entered and won an Okeh Records blues contest that resulted in his making a series of memorable recordings for the label between 1925 and 1932, including guitar duets with Eddie Lang and vocal duets with Victoria Spivey. In the 1920s, Johnson also made guest appearances on records by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five, the Duke Ellington orchestra, and The Chocolate Dandies, playing 12-string guitar solos in an extraordinary, pioneering single-string style that greatly influenced such future jazz guitarists as Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt, and gave the instrument new meaning as a jazz voice.      Lonnie Johnson’s career was a rollercoaster ride that sometimes took him away from music. In between great musical accomplishments, he found it necessary to take menial jobs that ranged from working in a steel foundry to mopping floors as a janitor. He was working at Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin Hotel in 1959 when WHAT-FM disc jockey Chris Albertson happened upon him. Albertson succeeded in securing for Johnson a Chicago engagement at the Playboy Club, which launched yet another comeback. Johnson subsequently performed with Duke Ellington and his orchestra and with an all-star folk concert, both at Town Hall, New York City.      He also toured Europe and recorded several albums for the Prestige Bluesville label, some with Elmer Snowden, and one with his Okeh vocal partner, Victoria Spivey. To his great regret, Johnson was always tagged as a blues artist, and he found it difficult to be regarded as anything else. “I had done some singing by then,” he explained when asked why he entered the Okeh contest, “but I still didn’t take it as seriously as my guitar playing, and I guess I would have done anything to get recorded—it just happened to be a blues contest, so I sang the blues.”      Johnson died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, June 16, 1970 of complications resulting from a 1969 auto accident. He was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame in 1997",13788,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'country blues', 'jazz blues', 'louisiana blues', 'memphis blues', 'new orleans blues', 'traditional blues']",lonnie johnson,35,"['Some Day Baby', 'Looking for a Sweetie', 'Blue Ghost Blues', 'Tomorrow Night - Remastered', 'Another Night to Cry', ""Tears Don't Fall No More"", 'Another Night To Cry - American Folk Blues Festival Version', 'A Handful Of Riffs', 'Raise the Window High', 'Tomorrow Night']"
"Frankie Laine, born Francesco Paolo LoVecchio (30 March 1913 – 6 February 2007), was an American singer and one of the more successful hit-makers of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Laine has had worldwide sales of over 250 million disks, and has earned 21 gold records. Originally a rhythm and blues influenced jazz singer, his energetic, passionate style has led some to consider him the first of the blue-eyed soul singers. Eventually he expanded to such varied genres as popular standards, gospel, folk, country, rock ‘n’ roll, and a hard-driving (and slightly campy) form of western/Americana.   … Throughout the 1950s, Laine enjoyed a second career singing the title songs of Hollywood films and television shows, including: Gunfight At OK Corral, 3:10 To Yuma, Bullwhip, and Rawhide. His rendition of the title song for Mel Brooks’ 1974 movie Blazing Saddles won an Oscar nomination for Best Song, and his recording of “Rawhide” for the television series of the same name has become a classic of the genre.

Perkins had a long association with musical collaborator [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash), and was a an influence on numerous artists including [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles), and [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones).   A highly regarded and influential American pioneer of rockabilly music, a mix of rhythm and blues and country music, recorded most notably at Sun Records in Memphis, beginning in 1954. An outstanding performer, his touch on rock and roll music is still heard to this day.   According to country musician [Charlie Daniels](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Daniels), “Carl Perkins’ songs personified the Rockabilly Era, and Carl Perkins’ sound personifies the Rockabilly Sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed.” Perkins’s songs have been recorded by artists as influential as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of popular music.      Carl Lee Perkins was the son of poor sharecroppers near Tiptonville, Tennessee. He grew up hearing Southern gospel music sung by whites in church and by black field workers when he started working in the cotton fields at age six. In the spring and fall, the school day would be followed by several hours of work in the fields. During the summer workdays were 12 - 14 hours, “from can to can’t”. Carl and his brother Jay together would earn 50 cents per day. With all family members working, and credit, there was enough money for beans and potatoes, some tobacco for Carl’s father Buck, and every so often the luxury of a five cent bag of hard candy.      On Saturday nights he would listen to the radio along with his father and hear music from the Grand Ole Opry. [Roy Acuff](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Acuff)’s broadcast performances on the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar. Because they couldn’t afford a real guitar, Carl’s father fashioned one from a cigar box and a broomstick.

Lacking the tall and lanky physical appearance typical of some male country stars, he successfully integrated pop and rock elements into his recordings and live performances. He soon began to dominate the country singles and country albums charts and quickly crossed over into the mainstream pop arena, selling records like no one else in country music ever had and exposing country music to a larger audience than previously thought possible.      Brooks enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, with over 70 hit singles and 15 charted albums to his credit and over 115 million albums sold in the US alone, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the 1990s. Possibly dissatisfied and looking to expand his career boundaries, he then attempted an artistically ambitious (but uncompleted) multimedia project involving a fictitious alter ego.      Troubled by the conflicts between career and family, the year after the decade ended Garth Brooks announced his retirement from recording and performing, thereby disappearing from the music world as suddenly as he had come.      Recently he has announced his return to live performances by agreeing to a 5 year 15 show a year contract in Vegas. His plan is to finish this contract, write some new stuff, and wait for his youngest daughter to go off to school, and then he plans to return to touring with his wife.

"The Kingston Trio is an American folk group. They helped launch the folk revival of the 1960s and continued to thrive despite the emergence of rock and roll.      The Kingston Trio was formed in 1957 in the Palo Alto, California area by Bob Shane, Nick Reynolds, and Dave Guard, who were just out of college. Greatly influenced by The Weavers, the calypso sounds of Harry Belafonte, and other semi-popular folk artists such as the Gateway Singers and the Tarriers, they were discovered playing at a college club called the Cracked Pot by Frank Werber, a local publicist then working at the Hungry i. He became their manager, and secured them a one-shot deal with Capitol Records.      Their first hit was a catchy rendition of an old-time folk song, “Tom Dooley”, which went gold in 1958. It was so popular that it entered popular culture as a catchphrase: Ella Fitzgerald, for example, parodies it during her recorded version of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”. It won them the first Grammy award for Best Country & Western Performance in 1959. The next year, they won the first Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording category for the album The Kingston Trio at Large.      At one point in the early 1960s The Kingston Trio had four albums at the same time among the Top 10 selling albums, a record unmatched for nearly 40 years. In spite of this, they had a relatively small number of hit singles.      The group’s music was simple and accessible, with much use of tight vocal harmony, signature riffs (often played on the banjo), and repetitive choruses. Capitol producer Voyle Gilmore[1] enhanced their vocal sound to great effect with reverb and the relatively new process of doubletracking, in which the performers sang along with their own pre-recorded part to produce a stronger sound than with a single voice, in part due to a natural time gap of a fraction of a second between the original recording and the overdubbed part. At first pairs of tape recorders were used, then later multitrack recording machines, to produce the effect.      Guard left the band in 1961 as part of a disagreement over its musical direction. He formed the group Whiskey Hill Singers, and was replaced by John Stewart, who led the group through several more years of popularity until the arrival of The Beatles and British invasion rock bands pushed them from the charts.      In 1967 the Trio disbanded after a final performance at the Hungry i, June 17, 1967.      Shane, the lone member to resist the break-up of the Trio, started a new group, aptly named, “The New Kingston Trio,” in 1969. Eventually, Shane was successful in reaching a contractual agreement with his former partners, Guard, Reynolds, and Werber, to secure and license once again, the original name, “The Kingston Trio” (unencumbered by the adjective new), in 1976.(Blake et al. 1986.)

"**[Everclear**](http://www.everclearonline.com) is a [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band formed in [Portland](http://www.last.fm/tag/portland), [Oregon](http://www.last.fm/tag/oregon), [USA](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20states), in 1992. For most of its existence, Everclear consisted of [Art Alexakis](http://www.last.fm/music/Art+Alexakis) (b. 12 April 1962, [Los Angeles](http://www.last.fm/tag/los%20angeles), [California](http://www.last.fm/tag/california), USA; vocals, guitar), Craig Montoya (b. 14 September 1970; bass, vocals) and Greg Eklund (b. 18 April 1970; drums). Eklund replaced original drummer Scott Cuthbert in 1994. Montoya and Eklund departed the band in 2003, but Alexakis has continued performing as Everclear with a new lineup.      After a solo tour in the fall of 2003, Alexakis decided to continue with Everclear, organizing a new band that made its debut in March of 2004. The new lineup consisted of bass player Sam Hudson, guitarist Dave French, and drummer Eric Bretl. In the summer of 2004, the band added keyboard player Josh Crawley, and swapped Bretl for former Everclear drum tech Brett Snyder. The new lineup released its first recording, a cover of Woody Guthrie’s [This Land Is Your Land](http://www.last.fm/music/Everclear/_/This+Land+Is+Your+Land), that summer. A self-released EP of performances recorded for XM Satellite Radio called [Closure](http://www.last.fm/music/Everclear/Closure) was given out at shows in the fall of 2004.      Free of a major label, Alexakis spent the ensuing year and half slowly recording material for a new Everclear release. He admitted that the time after the breakup of the original lineup served as a “wake up call”, during which he suffered his third divorce and a filing for bankruptcy. Alexakis announced the completion of the album in early 2006,titled [Welcome To The Drama Club](http://www.last.fm/music/Everclear/Welcome+To+The+Drama+Club). The new band is now on Eleven Seven Music.      In August of 2008, drummer Brett Snyder left the band after four years. He was then replaced by Tommy Stewart, who previously played in bands Fuel and Godsmack.

"Alvis Edgar Owens, Jr. (August 12, 1929 – March 25, 2006), better known as Buck Owens, was an American singer and guitarist who had 21 No. 1 hits on the Billboard [country music](http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20music) charts with his band, the Buckaroos. They pioneered what came to be called the Bakersfield sound—a reference to Bakersfield, California, the city Owens called home and from which he drew inspiration for what he preferred to call American music.      While Owens originally used fiddle and retained pedal steel guitar into the 1970s, his sound on records and onstage was always more stripped-down and elemental, incorporating elements of rock and roll. His signature style was based on simple storylines, infectious choruses, a twangy electric guitar, an insistent rhythm supplied by a drum track placed forward in the mix, and high two-part harmonies featuring Owens and his guitarist [Don Rich](http://www.last.fm/music/Don+Rich).      Beginning in 1969, Owens co-hosted the TV series Hee Haw with [Roy Clark](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Clark). He left the cast in 1986. In 1974, the accidental death of Rich, his best friend, devastated him for years and abruptly halted his career until he performed with [Dwight Yoakam](http://www.last.fm/music/Dwight+Yoakam) in 1988. Owens died on March 25, 2006 shortly after performing at his Crystal Palace restaurant, club and museum in Bakersfield.

"Billie Holiday (Eleanora Fagan Gough, Philadelphia, PA, April 7, 1915 – New York City, NY, July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.      Nicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner [Lester Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Lester+Young), Holiday was a highly original influence on jazz and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and intimate approach to singing. She co-wrote only a few songs, but several of them have become jazz standards, notably “[God Bless the Child](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/_/God+Bless+the+Child),” “[Don’t Explain](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/_/Don%27t+Explain),” and “[Lady Sings the Blues](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/_/Lady+Sings+the+Blues).” She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including “[Easy Living](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/_/Easy+Living)” and “[Strange Fruit](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/_/Strange+Fruit).”   Music critic Robert Christgau called her “uncoverable, possibly the greatest singer of the century”.   Critic John Bush wrote that she “changed the art of American pop vocals forever.”      Billie Holiday had a difficult childhood, which greatly affected her life and career. Not much is known about the true details of her early life, though stories of it appeared in her autobiography, _Lady Sings the Blues_, first published in 1956 and later revealed to contain many inaccuracies.      Her professional pseudonym was taken from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name “Halliday”, presumably to distance herself from her neglectful father, but eventually changed it back to “Holiday”.      There is some controversy regarding Holiday’s paternity, stemming from a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives that lists the father as a “Frank DeViese”. Some historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker.      Thrown out of her parents’ home in Baltimore after becoming pregnant at thirteen, Billie’s mother, Sadie Fagan, moved to Philadelphia where Billie was born. Mother and child eventually settled in a poor section of Baltimore. Her parents married when she was three, but they soon divorced, leaving her to be raised largely by her mother and other relatives. At the age of 10, she reported that she had been raped. That claim, combined with her frequent truancy, resulted in her being sent to The House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school, in 1925. It was only through the assistance of a family friend that she was released two years later. Scarred by these experiences, Holiday moved to New York City with her mother in 1928",1077480,blues,"['adult standards', 'jazz blues', 'lounge', 'soul', 'vocal jazz']",billie holiday,66,"[""I'll Be Seeing You"", 'Billie Holiday', 'All of Me (with Eddie Heywood & His Orchestra)', 'Strange Fruit', 'Crazy He Calls Me', 'Easy Living', 'April In Paris', ""I'll Look Around"", 'Autumn In New York', 'Blue Moon']"
"Coolio (born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr. on August 1, 1963 in Compton, California) is an American rapper and actor whose G-Funk sounding beats and funky flow make listening very pleasant. Coolio started his career as a member of the rap group, [WC And The Maad Circle](http://www.last.fm/music/WC+And+The+Maad+Circle).      In 1994, Coolio released his debut album [It Takes a Thief](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/It+Takes+a+Thief) which featured the hugely successful singles, [Fantastic Voyage](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/Fantastic+Voyage) and [It Takes a Thief](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/It+Takes+a+Thief). In 1995 Coolio released his second and most successful album [Gangsta’s Paradise](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/Gangsta%27s+Paradise), which went 4X Platinum and featured the mega hit, [Gangsta’s Paradise](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/Gangsta%27s+Paradise) and the popular party track, [Sumpin New](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/Sumpin+New). The album ‘Gangsta’s Paradise” is considered by some to be a classic west coast Gangsta rap album, thanks to songs like [Exercise Yo Game](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/Exercise+Yo+Game) and [Geto Highlites](http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/Geto+Highlites). His G-Funk sounding beats and soulful flow softens the typically edgy effect of rap. His hit song “Gangsta’s Paradise” combined singing with rap.

"Howard Andrew Williams (born December 3, 1927 in Wall Lake, Iowa, died September 26, 2012), known as Andy Williams, is an American [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) singer.      He first performed in a children’s choir at his local Presbyterian church. Williams and his three older brothers Bob, Dick, and Don, formed a quartet, [The Williams Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Williams+Brothers), in the late 1930s. The brothers performed on radio in the Midwest, first at WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, and later at WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati. Williams graduated from Western Hills High School in Cincinnati. They appeared with Bing Crosby on the hit record “Swinging on a Star” (1944). This led to a nightclub act with entertainer Kay Thompson from 1947 to 1951.      Williams’s solo career began in 1952 after his brothers left the act. He recorded six sides for RCA’s label “X,” but none of them were popular hits. After landing a spot as a regular on [Steve Allen](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Allen)’s Tonight Show in 1955, he was signed to a recording contract with Cadence Records, a small label in New York run by conductor Archie Bleyer. His third single, “Canadian Sunset” (1956) hit the Top Ten, and was soon followed his only Billboard #1 hit, “Butterfly” (a cover of a [Charlie Gracie](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Gracie) record on which Williams imitated [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley)). More hits followed, including “The Hawaiian Wedding Song,” “Are You Sincere,” “The Village of St. Bernadette,” and “Lonely Street,” before Williams moved to Columbia Records in 1961, having moved from New York to Los Angeles. In terms of chart popularity, the Cadence era was Williams’s peak although songs he introduced on Columbia became much bigger standards. Two top ten hits from the Cadence era, “Butterfly” and “I Like Your Kind of Love” were apparently believed to not suit Williams’s later style; they were not included on a Columbia reissue of his Cadence greatest hits in the 1960s.      During the 1960s, Williams became one of the most popular vocalists in the country and signed what was to that time the biggest recording contract in history. He was primarily an album artist, and at one time he had earned more gold albums than any solo performer except Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. By 1973 he had earned as many as 17 gold album awards. Among his hit albums from this period were Moon River, Days of Wine and Roses (number one for 16 weeks in mid-1963), The Andy Williams Christmas Album, Dear Heart, The Shadow of Your Smile, Love, Andy, Get Together with Andy Williams, and Love Story. In these recordings Williams displays an incredible vocal technique along with an uncanny ability to make each song his very own, often rivaling or surpassing the version by the original artist",218513,country,"['adult standards', 'brill building pop', 'easy listening', 'lounge', 'mellow gold', 'operatic pop']",andy williams,61,"['Moon River (From ""Breakfast at Tiffany\'s"")', ""It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"", ""Can't Get Used to Losing You - Single Version"", 'A Summer Place', 'Where Do I Begin - Love Theme from ""Love Story""', 'Happy Holiday / The Holiday Season', 'Hawaiian Wedding Song', 'Sleigh Ride', ""I'll Never Stop Loving You"", 'The Impossible Dream (The Quest)']"
"**Big Joe Turner** (Joseph Vernon Turner Jr., Kansas City, Missouri, May 18, 1911 – Inglewood, California, November 24, 1985) was an **American blues shouter**.       Although he came to his greatest fame in the 1950s with his pioneering rock and roll recordings, particularly “[Shake, Rattle and Roll](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Joe+Turner/_/Shake,+Rattle+and+Roll)”, Turner’s career as a performer stretched from the 1920s into the 1980s.   (for **stride pianist** Joseph H. Turner (3.11.07-21.7.90) >** [Joe Turner](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Turner)**)      Known variously as The Boss of the Blues, and Big Joe Turner (due to his 6’2”, 300+ lbs stature), Turner was born in Kansas City and first discovered his love of music through involvement in the church. Turner’s father was killed in a train accident when Joe was only four years old. He began singing on street corners for money, leaving school at age fourteen to begin working in Kansas City’s club scene, first as a cook, and later as a singing bartender. He eventually became known as The Singing Barman, and worked in such venues as The Kingfish Club and The Sunset, where he and his piano playing partner [Pete Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Johnson) became resident performers. The Sunset was managed by Piney Brown. It featured “separate but equal” facilities for white patrons. Turner wrote “[Piney Brown Blues](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Joe+Turner/_/Piney+Brown+Blues)” in his honor and sang it throughout his entire career.      At that time Kansas City was a wide-open town run by “Boss” Tom Pendergast. Despite this, the clubs were subject to frequent raids by the police, but as Turner recounts, “The Boss man would have his bondsmen down at the police station before we got there. We’d walk in, sign our names and walk right out. Then we would cabaret until morning”.      His partnership with boogie-woogie pianist [Pete Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Johnson) proved fruitful. Together they headed to New York in 1936, where they appeared on a bill with [Benny Goodman](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman), but as Turner recounts, “After our show with Goodman, we auditioned at several places, but New York wasn’t ready for us yet, so we headed back to K.C.”. Eventually they were spotted by the talent scout, John H. Hammond in 1938, who invited them back to New York to appear in one of his “From Spirituals to Swing” concerts at Carnegie Hall, which was instrumental in introducing jazz and blues to a wider American audience.      Due in part to their appearance at Carnegie Hall, Turner and Johnson scored a major hit with “[Roll ‘Em Pete](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Joe+Turner/_/Roll+%27Em+Pete)”. The track contained one of the earliest recorded examples of a back beat. It was a song which Turner recorded many times, with various combinations of musicians, over the ensuing years.      In 1939, along with boogie players [Albert Ammons](http://www.last",20524,blues,"['blues', 'boogie-woogie', 'jump blues', 'rhythm and blues', 'rock-and-roll', 'rockabilly', 'traditional blues']",big joe turner,42,"['Shake, Rattle and Roll', 'Well All Right', 'S.K.

"The **Jungle Brothers** are an American hip hop group who pioneered the fusion of jazz and hip-hop. They began performing in the mid-1980s and released their first album, Straight Out the Jungle, in 1988. With Afrocentric lyrics and innovative beats, the Jungle Brothers were critically acclaimed and soon joined the influential [Native Tongues](http://www.last.fm/music/Native+Tongues) Posse. The trio is comprised of **Michael Small** (**Mike Gee**), **Nathaniel Hall** (**Afrika Baby Bam**) and **Sammy Burwell** (**DJ Sammy B**).      Their first album, “Straight Out the Jungle”, was released on an independent label and featured a hip hop/house collaboration “I’ll House You” produced by Todd Terry. In spite of the commercial failure of Straight Out the Jungle, Warner Brothers Records soon signed the group and released “Done By the Forces of Nature” in 1989. The album was a critical smash at the time, though it has since been largely ignored by hip hop critics, due to the similarly acclaimed fusion of jazz and rap “3 Feet High and Rising” by [De La Soul](http://www.last.fm/music/De+La+Soul) being released the same year. Following a four year break, the Jungle Brothers returned in 1993 with “J Beez Wit the Remedy”, another commercial disappointment. Their next album, “V.I.P.” was produced by Alex Gifford of Propellerheads and, during production, they found time to add their vocal stylings to the Propellerheads tracks “Take California (And Party)” and “You Want It Back”. In 2002 they released “All That We Do”. In 2005, the Jungle Brothers released a “greatest hits” and “classic remixes & rarities” double-CD entitled “This Is…”, which included remixes by The Wiseguys, Urban Takeover, Natural Born Chillers and Stereo MCs.

"Propellerheads is a British [big beat](http://www.last.fm/tag/big%20beat) music band from Bath made up of [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) producers [Will White](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+White) and [Alex Gifford](http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Gifford). The term “Propellerhead” is [california](http://www.last.fm/tag/california)n slang for a computer nerd, and when Gifford and White heard a friend from California drop this into conversation, they thought it the perfect name for their band.      Their first release was an EP named [Dive!](http://www.last.fm/music/Propellerheads/Dive!), published in 1996 through independent label [wall of sound](http://www.last.fm/tag/wall%20of%20sound). They gained fame the next year by providing a remix for Bond composer [David Arnold](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Arnold)’s Bond tribute album Shaken & Stirred covering [John Barry](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Barry)’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, the theme song to the sixth James Bond film, re- orchestrated by Arnold. The single “History Repeating” followed, a collaboration with jazz diva [Shirley Bassey](http://www.last.fm/music/Shirley+Bassey), fusing big beat with jazz.      Their only album to date is [Decksandrumsandrockandroll](http://www.last.fm/mu sic/Propellerheads/Decksandrumsandrockandroll), released in 1998 by Wall of Sound in the UK and Europe and DreamWorks in the US and Japan. The Dreamworks versions include collaborations with hip hop veterans De La Soul and Jungle Brothers, and the Japanese version is a sought-after 2 Disc Special Edition including some of their earlier singles. A track from the album, “Spybreak!”, became widely known after its use in the famous lobby scene in The Matrix.      After touring for their hit album, Will White fell ill. They released Extended Play EP in 1998, and in the song “Props’ Vote Of Gratitude”, Alex Gifford raps for the first time, explaining to the attentive listener that the band would “be back after this short break”. Things subsequently went quiet in the Propellerheads camp. Alex moved to New York and produced the Jungle Brothers 1999 Album V.I.P. In which he raps alongside The Black Eyed Peas among others and Will White provides the drums for the eponymous track. He has also produced a track for Rufus Wainwright (“Shadows”) on his 2001 album Poses. White has since released a mix compilation for the Beatz and Bobz series, and he has also appeared as a member of the De-Fex music project.      In October 2003 Wall of Sound commemorated its 10th birthday, and to celebrate, released a two disc album charting 10 years of its pioneering British music.

"**Bob Dylan** (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States)) is an American musician, [poet](http://www.last.fm/tag/poet) and artist whose position in popular culture is unique.      Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962.      Much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by [Joan Baez](http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Baez). Some of his songs, such as “[Blowin’ in the Wind](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Blowin%27+in+the+Wind)” and “[The Times They Are a-Changin’](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/The+Times+They +Are+a-Changin%27)”, became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with [Joan Baez](http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Baez) and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.      His album [Bringing It All Back Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home) marked a move away from the [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) scene and a move towards [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. [Bringing It All Back Home](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home) was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.      The second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song “[Like a Rolling Stone](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Like+a+Rolling+Stone)”, released in July of 1965, later being named “The Greatest Song of All Time” by _Rolling Stone_ magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan’s backing band [The Hawks](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Hawks) (who would later call themselves simply [The Band](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band)). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work",3570419,folk,"['album rock', 'classic rock', 'folk', 'folk rock', 'folk-pop', 'mellow gold', 'rock', 'roots rock', 'singer-songwriter']",bob dylan,76,"[""Knockin' On Heaven's Door - Remastered"", 'Like a Rolling Stone', ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", 'Tangled up in Blue', ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"", ""Blowin' in the Wind"", 'Hurricane', 'Girl from the North Country (with Johnny Cash)', 'Shelter from the Storm', 'Mr. Tambourine Man']"
"Charles Christopher “Bird” Parker, Jr (29th August 1920 – 12th March 1955) was a U.S. [bebop](http://www.last.fm/tag/bebop) saxophonist and composer. Early in his career Parker was dubbed Yardbird; this was later shortened to “Bird” (or sometimes “Yard”) and remained Parker’s nickname for the rest of his life, and inspiration for the titles of his works such as “[Ornithology](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker/_/Ornithology) and [Yardbird Suite](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker/_/Yardbird+Suite)”.      Parker is commonly considered the greatest bebop jazz musician. In terms of influence and impact, his contribution to jazz was so great that [Charles Mingus](http://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Mingus) commented that if Bird were alive today, he would think he was living in a hall of mirrors. Bird’s talent is compared almost without argument to such legendary musicians as [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong) and [Duke Ellington](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington), and his reputation and legend as one of the best saxophonists is such that some critics say he was unsurpassed.      A founding figure of bebop, Parker’s innovative approach to melody, rhythm and harmony have exerted an incalculable influence on jazz… Several of Parker’s songs have become standards of the repertoire, and innumerable musicians have studied Parker’s music and absorbed elements of his style.      Parker became an icon for the Beat generation, and was a pivotal figure in the evolving conception of the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual, rather than just a popular entertainer. At various times, Parker fused jazz with other musical styles, from classical (seeking to study with [Edgard Varese](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Edgard+Varese) and [Stefan Wolpe](http://www.last.fm/music/Stefan+Wolpe)) to Latin music (recordings with [Machito](http://www.last.fm/music/Machito)), blazing paths followed later by others.      Parker was known for often showing up to performances without an instrument and borrowing someone else’s at the last moment. At more than one venue he played on a plastic Grafton saxophone; later, saxophonist Ornette Coleman used this brand of plastic sax in his early career. On one particular occasion before a concert in Toronto, Canada, he had sold his saxophone to buy drugs, and at the last minute, he, Dizzy Gillespie and other members of Charlie’s entourage went running around Toronto trying to find a saxophone. After scouring all the downtown pawnshops open at the time, they were only able to find a Grafton, which Parker proceeded to use at the concert that night. This concert is documented on the album _Jazz at Massey Hall_. The album is considered one of the greatest live recordings in Jazz history.      Parker’s battles with alcoholism and heroin addiction ranged from his teenage years until his death from pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer at thirty-four",339567,jazz,"['bebop', 'big band', 'contemporary post-bop', 'cool jazz', 'hard bop', 'jazz', 'jazz fusion', 'jazz saxophone', 'soul jazz']",charlie parker,53,"['Summertime', 'Ornithology', 'Scrapple From The Apple', 'Just Friends', 'Koko - Original Take 2', ""Parker's Mood - New Take 1"", ""Billie's Bounce - Original"", 'An Oscar For Treadwell - Incomplete 411-1', 'Donna Lee', 'Leap Frog - Take 11 / Take 6 / Master']"
"Johnny Cash (born J.R. Cash, February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was a Grammy Award-winning American [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) singer and songwriter.      Cash is widely considered to be one of the most influential American musicians of the 20th century. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple induction in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.      Cash was known for his deep, distinctive voice, the boom-chick-a-boom or _”freight train”_ sound of his backing band (Tennessee Two / Tennessee Three), his demeanor, and his dark clothing, which earned him the nickname _”The Man in Black”_. He traditionally started his concerts with the introduction _”Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.”_      Much of Cash’s music, especially that of his later career, echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption. His signature songs include “[I Walk the Line](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/I+Walk+the+Line)”, “[Folsom Prison Blues](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Folsom+Prison+Blues)”, “[Ring of Fire](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Ring+of+Fire)”, “[That Old Wheel](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/That+Old+Wheel)” (a duet with Hank Williams Jr.), “[Cocaine Blues](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Cocaine+Blues)”, and “[Man in Black](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Man+in+Black)”. He also recorded several humorous songs, such as “[One Piece At A Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/One+Piece+At+A+Time)”, “[The One On The Right Is On The Left](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Johnny+Cash/ _/The+One+On+The+Right+Is+On+The+Left)”, “[Dirty Old Egg-Sucking Dog](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Dirty+Old+Egg-Sucking+Dog)” and “[A Boy Named Sue](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/A+Boy+Named+Sue)”; rock-and-roll numbers such as “[Get Rhythm](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Get+Rhythm)”; and various railroad songs, such as “[Rock Island Line](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Rock+Island+Line)” and “[Orange Blossom Special](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Orange+Blossom+Special)”.      He sold over 90 million albums in his nearly fifty-year career and came to occupy a _”commanding position in music history”_.      **Early life**   Johnny Cash was born J. R. Cash in Kingsland, Arkansas, [United States](http://www.last.fm/place/United+States), to Ray and Carrie Cash, and raised in Dyess, Arkansas. He was reportedly given the name “J. R.” because his parents could not agree on a name, only on initials. Giving children initials-only names, or a first name and middle initial only, was a common practice at the time. When he enlisted in the United States Air Force, the military would not accept initials as his name, so he adopted John R.

"Big Bill Broonzy (June 26, 1893 – August 15, 1958) was a prolific American blues singer, songwriter and guitarist. His career began in the 1920s when he played country blues to mostly African-American audiences. Through the 1930s and 1940s he successfully navigated a transition in style to a more urban blues sound popular with working class African-American audiences. In the 1950s a return to his traditional folk-blues roots made him one of the leading figures of the emerging American folk music revival and an international star. His long and varied career marks him as one of the key figures in the development of blues music in the 20th century.   Broonzy copyrighted more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including both adaptations of traditional folk songs and original blues songs. As a blues composer, he was unique in that his compositions reflected the many vantage points of his rural-to-urban experiences.      Born Lee Conley Bradley, “Big Bill” was one of Frank Broonzy (Bradley) and Mittie Belcher’s 17 children. His birth site and date are disputed. While he claimed birth in Scott County, Mississippi, an entire body of emerging research compiled by blues historian Robert Reisman suggests that Broonzy was actually born in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Broonzy claimed he was born in 1893 and many sources report that year, but after his death, family records suggested that the year was actually 1903. Soon after his birth the family moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Bill spent his youth. He began playing music at an early age. At the age of 10 he made himself a fiddle from a cigar box and learned how to play spirituals and folk songs from his uncle, Jerry Belcher. He and a friend named Louis Carter, who played a homemade guitar, began performing at social and church functions. These early performances included playing at “two-stages”: picnics where whites danced on one side of the stage and blacks on the other.   On the understanding that he was born in 1898 rather than earlier or later, sources suggest that in 1915, 17-year-old Broonzy was married and working as a sharecropper. He had decided to give up the fiddle and become a preacher. There is a story that he was offered $50 and a new violin if he would play four days at a local venue. Before he could respond to the offer, his wife took the money and spent it, so he had to play. In 1916 his crop and stock were wiped out by drought. Broonzy went to work locally until he was drafted into the Army in 1917. Broonzy served two years in Europe during the first world war. Then after his discharge from the Army in 1919, Broonzy returned to Pine Bluff, Arkansas where he is reported to have been called a racial epithet and told by a white man he knew before the war that he needed to “hurry up and get his soldier uniform off and put on some overalls.” He immediately left Pine Bluff and moved to the Little Rock area but a year later in 1920 moved north to Chicago in search of opportunity",27943,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'chicago blues', 'country blues', 'traditional blues', 'traditional folk']",big bill broonzy,38,"['Glory of Love', 'Mean Old World (Tk. 1)', 'This Train (Bound For Glory)', 'I Feel So Good', 'Get Back', 'I Got the Blues', 'When Did You Leave Heaven?', 'Get Back', 'Southbound Train', 'Hey, Hey Baby']"
"John Lee Hooker (Coahoma County, Mississippi, August 22, 1917 – Los Altos, California, June 21, 2001) was a highly influential American blues singer, guitarist and songwriter.      John Lee Hooker could be said to embody his own unique genre of the [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues), often incorporating the [boogie- woogie](http://www.last.fm/tag/boogie-woogie) piano style and a driving rhythm into his masterful and idiosyncratic blues guitar and singing. His best known songs include “[Boogie Chillen](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lee+Hooker/_/Boogie+Chillen)” (1948) and “[Boom Boom](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lee+Hooker/_/Boom+Boom)” (1962).      There is some debate as to the year of John Lee Hooker’s birth, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been cited, 1917 (the date on his grave marker in Oakland, California) is the one most commonly cited although Hooker himself claimed, at times, 1920.      Hooker was the youngest of the eleven children of William Hooker (1871–1923), a sharecropper and a Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (1875–?).   Hooker and his siblings were home-schooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs, with his earliest musical exposure being the spirituals sung in church.   In 1921, his parents separated. The next year, his mother married William Moore, a blues singer who provided John’s first introduction to the guitar (and whom John would later credit for his distinctive playing style). The year after that (1923), John’s natural father died; and at age 15, John ran away from home, never to see his mother and stepfather again.      He was a cousin of [Earl Hooker](http://www.last.fm/music/Earl+Hooker),      Throughout the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis where he worked on Beale Street and occasionally performed at house parties. He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, drifting until he found himself in Detroit in 1948 working at Ford Motor Company. He felt right at home near the blues venues and saloons on Hastings Street, the heart of black entertainment on Detroit’s east side. In a city noted for its piano players, guitar players were scarce. Performing in Detroit clubs, his popularity grew quickly, and seeking a louder instrument than his crude acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.      Though he stuttered slightly in his normal speech, he performed in a half- spoken style that became his trademark. Rhythmically, his music was free, a property common with early acoustic [delta blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/delta%20blues) musicians. His vocal phrasing was less closely tied to specific bars than most [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) singers’. This casual, rambling style had been gradually diminishing with the onset of [electric blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/electric%20blues) bands from Chicago but, even when not playing solo, Hooker retained it in his sound.      Hooker’s recording career began in 1948 with the hit single, “[Boogie Chillen](http://www.last",445096,blues,"['blues', 'blues-rock', 'classic rock', 'delta blues', 'electric blues', 'memphis blues', 'modern blues', 'soul', 'traditional blues']",john lee hooker,57,"['Boom Boom', 'One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer', ""I'm In The Mood - Single Version"", 'Pouring Down Rain', 'It Serves You Right To Suffer - The Avener Rework', 'Chill Out (Things Gonna Change)', 'The Healer', 'Boogie Chillen', 'Boogie Chillen', 'I Need Some Money']"

"André Romelle Young (born February 18, 1965 in Los Angeles, California), better known by his stage name Dr. Dre, is an American record producer, rapper, actor and record executive. He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and a former co-owner and artist of Death Row Records, also having produced albums for and overseeing the careers of many rappers signed to those record labels. As a producer he is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, bass heavy beats.   Dr. Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin’ Cru and he later found fame with the influential gangsta rap group N.W.A, which popularized the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut The Chronic, released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993. In 1996 he left Death Row to found his own label Aftermath Entertainment, producing a compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, in 1997 and releasing a solo album titled 2001 in 1999.      During the 2000s he focused his career on production for other artists, while occasionally contributing vocals in other artists’ songs. Rolling Stone named him among the highest-paid performers of 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre also had acting roles in the 2001 films The Wash and Training Day. In 2011, his final solo studio album, Detox, is set to be released following much delay and speculation.      Early life      The first child of Verna and Theodore Young, Dr. Dre was born as André Romelle Young on February 18, 1965. His mother was only 16 years old at the time of his birth, after being impregnated by teenage boyfriend Theodore, whom she later married. Young’s middle name, “Romelle”, came from Theodore Young’s unsigned, amateur R&B singing group The Romells. In 1968 his mother divorced Theodore Young for another man, Curtis Crayon, and had other children with him, including two sons named Jerome and Tyree (both of whom are now deceased)[8][9] and daughter Shameka.[10] As a young child, Young was fascinated with vinyl records spinning on phonographs; his family’s record collection included many popular R&B albums of the 1960s and 1970s, from such singers as Diana Ross, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin. According to an interview with the Los Angeles Times, his mother Verna found R&B music to be a relief from the two jobs she had to work daily.[11] Despite economic troubles, she continued to encourage Young not to give up in life. During Verna’s second marriage, Young and his step-brother Tyree were raised primarily by their grandmother and Curtis Crayon, as their mother spent much time in search of work.[12]      In 1976 Young began attending Vanguard Junior High School and had a new sister named Shameka. However, due to gang violence around Vanguard, he transferred to nearby Roosevelt Junior High School",4462240,world,"['g funk', 'gangster rap', 'hip hop', 'rap', 'west coast rap']",dr. dre,80,"['Forgot About Dre', 'Still D.R.E.', 'No Diggity', 'The Next Episode', 'California Love - Original Version', 'I Need A Doctor', ""What's The Difference"", 'Xxplosive', ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'"", 'California Love - Original Version']"
"Harry Lillis “Bing” Crosby (born May 2, 1903 in Tacoma, Washington; died October 14, 1977 in Madrid, Spain) was an American Grammy Award winning singer and Academy Award winning actor who was one of the first true multimedia stars, from 1934 to 1954 Crosby held a nearly unrivaled command of record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses. Widely recognized as one of the most popular musical acts in history, Crosby is also credited as being the major inspiration for most of the male singers of the era that followed him, including [Perry Como](http://www.last.fm/music/Perry+Como), [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra), and [Dean Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Martin). In 1962, Crosby was the first person to be recognized with the Grammy Global Achievement Award and is one of the few people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O’Malley in the 1944 motion picture Going My Way.      Bing Crosby’s influence on popular culture and popular music is considerable, as from 1934 to 1954 he held a nearly unrivaled command of record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses. He is usually considered to be a member of popular music’s “holy trinity” of ultra-icons, alongside [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley) and [The Beatles](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles).      Bing Crosby popularized singing with conversational ease, or ‘crooning’. His musical interpretations amalgamated rhythm and romance with scat singing, whistling, rhythmic improvisation and melodic paraphrasing as elements of a hotter, sexier sound than had been conceived before.      In 1926, while singing at Los Angeles Metropolitan Theater, Crosby and his vocal duo partner Al Rinker caught the eye of Paul Whiteman, arguably the most famous bandleader at the time. Hired for $150 a week, they made their debut on December 6, 1926 at the Tivoli Theatre (Chicago). Their first recording, “I’ve Got The Girl,” with Don Clark’s Orchestra, was issued by Columbia and did them no vocal favors as it sounded as if they were singing in a key much too high for them. It was later revealed that the 78 rpm was recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the pitch when played at 78 rpm.      Crosby is also credited as being the major inspiration for most of the male singers that followed him, including the likes of [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra), [Perry Como](http://www.last.fm/music/Perry+Como) and [Dean Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Martin).

"Carl Terrell Mitchell (born November 27, 1973 in Chicago, Illinois), better known by his stage name Twista and formerly Tung Twista, is an American rapper who once held the title of fastest emcee in the world, being able to pronounce 11.2 syllables per second. In 1992 he released his debut album, Runnin’ Off At Da Mouth, and has since released a further seven albums including 1994’s Resurrection, 1997’s Adrenaline Rush, 2004’s highly successful Kamikaze, 2005’s The Day After and 2007’s Adrenaline Rush 2007. His latest studio album, Category F5, was released in July of 2009.      Twista grew up in the K-Town area on the west side of Chicago. He started rapping at the age of 12. However, before starting his professional career, he worked at several other jobs including working at a factory, selling shoes, working at McDonald’s, working as a security guard, and even cutting hair.      Twista was one of the first artists to sign with Loud Records. In 1991, he released Runnin’ off at da Mouth under the name of Tung Twista. Due to his rapid-fire pace of delivery, he was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s fastest rapper. Despite this recognition, the album achieved little success. Tung Twista dropped the “Tung” off of his name in his second album Resurrection, which was never released outside of Chicago’s underground.      In 1996, he teamed with fellow Chicago act “Do or Die” on the track “Po’ Pimp” leading to a contract with Atlantic Records. He released Adrenaline Rush in 1997 followed by Mobstability in 1998. Twista then formed his own Legit Ballin’ label which has released two compilation albums Legit Ballin’ in 1999 and Legit Ballin’ Vol. 2: Street Scriptures in 2001. The label later released Respect The Game,Vol. 3 in 2002 and Volume 4: Tha Truth in 2006.      Twista developed a good reputation in rap circles leading to work with Mariah Carey, P. Diddy (then Puff Daddy),Lil kim, Drag-on, Jay-Z, Timbaland, Ras Kass, Ludacris, Royce Da 5’9”, Shaquille O’Neal, and Da Brat. However, it would take him until 2004 to achieve a platinum, number-one record under his own name.      On his website, Twista stated that he made Kamikaze to show that he was still true to the ideals that he had when he started out. “I represent for the MCs that have skills, not just make music for the hell of it. I take the time to concentrate. Otherwise, I could have 10 albums out there, easy. I could sit down all day and write something. But I write when I get in a zone more than writing because I’ve got to do this. I represent the artists that keep it true to what really is, to be able to make rappers want to write.”      “I want to show the streets that I’m back and that I’m true to the game. Musically, I want to show that I’m still out here doing my thing. After all the people that were out when I was out years ago fell off, I’m still out here competing with the shorties. I also want to gain platinum success.

"Original Dixieland Jass Band (after mid-1917 spelling changed to Jazz) A Chicago that played the popular Dixieland Jazz style. A band which, in 1917, was the first ever to make a jazz recording. It was also the first jazz band to achieve widespread prominence. The Original Dixieland Jass Band are often known by their initials, the O.D.J.B.      The band consisted of 5 white musicians who had previously been playing in the Papa Jack Laine bands, a diverse and racially integrated collection of musicians who played for parades, dances, and advertising in New Orleans.      The O.D.J.B. were billed as the “Creators of Jazz”. Trumpeter Nick LaRocca convinced himself, in his old age, that this was literally true, but there is no evidence from the interviews and writings of the other O.D.J.B. members that the rest of the band ever considered it anything more than a snappy advertising slogan.      In early 1916 a promoter from Chicago, Illinois approached clarinetist Alcide Nunez and drummer Johnny Stein about bringing a New Orleans style band to Chicago, where a similar band led by trombonist Tom Brown was already enjoying success. They then assembled trombonist Eddie Edwards, pianist Henry Ragas and cornetist Frank Christian. Shortly before they were to leave, Christian backed out, and Nick LaRocca was hired as a last minute replacement.      On March 3, 1916 the musicians began their job at Schiller’s Cafe in Chicago under the name Stein’s Dixie Jass Band. The band was a hit and received offers of higher pay elsewhere. Since Stein as leader was the only musician under contract by name, the rest of the band broke off, sent to New Orleans for drummer Tony Sbarbaro, and on June 5 started playing renamed as The Dixie Jass Band. LaRocca and Nunez had personality conflicts, and on October 30 Tom Brown’s Band and the ODJB mutually agreed to switch clarinetists, bringing Larry Shields into the Original Dixieland Jass Band. The band attracted the attention of Max Hart, who booked the band in New York City. At the start of 1917 the band began an engagement playing for dancing at Reisenweber’s Cafe in Manhattan.      While a couple of other New Orleans bands had passed through New York City slightly earlier, they were part of Vaudeville acts. The O.D.J.B., on the other hand, played for dancing and were hence the first “jass” band to get a following of fans in New York, and then record at a time when the USA’s recording industry was almost entirely centered in New York and New Jersey.      Shortly after arriving in New York they were offered a chance per a letter dated January 29, 1917 to audition for the Columbia Graphaphone Company which took place on Wednesday, January 31, 1917. Nothing came of this audition.      They then recorded two sides (“Livery Stable Blues” and “Dixie Jass Band One Step”) on February 26, 1917 for the Victor Talking Machine Company. The record with these titles came out the following month",9603,jazz,"['big band', 'dixieland', 'new orleans jazz', 'ragtime', 'swing']",original dixieland jazz band,27,"['Livery Stable Blues', 'Tiger Rag', 'Tiger Rag', 'Dixie Jass Band One-Step', 'St. Louis Blues', 'Clarinet Marmalade', 'Bow Wow Blues (My Mama Treats Me Like A Dog)', 'Livery Stable Blues', 'Skeleton Jangle', ""Bluin' the Blues""]"

They have released a number of works, most notably the studio albums _[Music Has the Right to Children](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/Music+Has+the+Right+to+Children)_ (1998), _[Geogaddi](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/Geogaddi)_ (2002), and _[The Campfire Headphase](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/The+Campfire+Headphase)_ (2005) on the pioneering electronic music label [Warp](http://www.last.fm/label/Warp). Their fourth album _[Tomorrow’s Harvest](http://www.last.fm/music/Boards+of+Canada/Tomorrow%27s+Harvest)_ was released in June 2013.      Boards of Canada have had an enormous influence on the [ambient](http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient), [downtempo](http://www.last.fm/tag/downtempo) and [idm](http://www.last.fm/tag/idm) scenes. They have frequently made reference to the warm, scratchy, artificial sounds of 1970s television. Indeed, the Sandison brothers admit to being inspired by the documentary films of the National Film Board of Canada, from which they take their name. The duo have recorded a few minor works under the name Hell Interface. Boards of Canada’s music has been used in several CSI episodes and on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim interlude shorts; small bits of their music have been used on the BBC program Top Gear for transitional music.      **Early Boards of Canada (1970s-1995)**      Growing up in a musical family, brothers Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin began playing instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques at around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands, however, it wasn’t until 1986 when Marcus was invited to Mike’s band that Boards of Canada was born.      By 1989, the band had been reduced to Sandison, Eoin and Christopher Horne. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small, fairly regular shows among the “Hexagon Sun” collective.      In early 2000, the official website for the band, Music70.com (now boardsofcanada.com) removed the early discography of Boards of Canada, although some information has been preserved by fans. Early tape releases by Boards of Canada include “Play by Numbers”, “Acid Memories”, “Hooper Bay”, and the earliest known release by the band is titled “Catalog 3”. None of the material from those days is readily available, and since official Boards of Canada sources ignore the existence of this material, there seems to be little chance for this early material to ever resurface",320098,electronic,"['ambient', 'electronic', 'fourth world', 'intelligent dance music', 'microhouse', 'post-rock', 'scottish electronic', 'trip hop']",boards of canada,59,"['Roygbiv', 'Peacock Tail', 'Everything You Do Is A Balloon', 'Dayvan Cowboy', 'Chromakey Dreamcoat', 'Olson', 'Wildlife Analysis', 'Over The Horizon Radar', 'Aquarius', 'Reach For The Dead']"

"Dire Straits were a [british](http://www.last.fm/tag/british) [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band from Newcastle, United Kingdom, formed in 1977 by [Mark Knopfler](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Knopfler) (guitar and vocals), his brother [David Knopfler](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Knopfler) (guitar), [John Illsley](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Illsley) (bass), and Pick Withers (drums), and subsequently managed by Ed Bicknell. Dire Straits emerged during the [post-punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/post-punk) era of the late ’70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to [punk](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk). If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of [pub rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pub%20rock), but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist [Mark Knopfler](http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Knopfler), the group built their sound upon the laid-back [blues-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues-rock) of [J.J. Cale](http://www.last.fm/music/J.J.+Cale), but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of [progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock). The band’s music was offset by Knopfler’s lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream- of-conscious narratives of [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan). As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-’80s helped make Dire Straits’ fifth studio album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band - along with [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton), [Phil Collins](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins), and [Steve Winwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Winwood) \- became one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock & rollers in the late ’80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band’s international success, they couldn’t sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly.      Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called “Brewer’s Droop” at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing “Sultans of Swing” on his BBC show Honky Tonkin’.

"**Counting Crows** is an American [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band originating from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1991, the group gained fame in 1993 following the release of their debut album, titled ‘_[August And Everything After](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/August+And+Everything+After)_’, when track “[Mr. Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/_/Mr.+Jones)” became a big hit. Known for their melancholic yet melodic songwriting, the band started when singer Adam Duritz (previously of [The Himalayans](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Himalayans) and [Sordid Humor](http://www.last.fm/music/Sordid+Humor)) teamed up with guitarist David Bryson (local producer and former member of the band [Mr. Dog](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Dog)) in San Francisco, California in 1990. Counting Crows originally performed as an acoustic duo, playing gigs in and around the cities of Berkeley and San Francisco.      For the group’s first album, Adam and David added bassist Matt Malley, multi- instrument talent Charlie Gillingham, and drummer Steve Bowman. David Immergluck served as the second guitarist on the first album, but he did not officially join the band until 1999. Guitarist Dan Vickery was added just as the band set out on their first tour. As stated before, ‘_[August And Everything After](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/August+And+Everything+After)_’ provided the band with a surprise yet very welcome success, garnering them critical praise. Released on September 14, 1993 through Geffen Records, the album hit #2 on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart, showing that their tunes had tapped into something.      Counting Crows, with their intimate and confessional yet smooth, often catchy musical approach, achieved a large fan base among melodic rock fans over the years. Their [90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s) acclaim reflected that a significant music scene looked for something different from the raging guitars of the Seattle-based grunge movement as well as from either boilerplate pop music or the budding electronic music subgenres. The group kept on releasing new songs into the new millennium.      The band’s more recent successes include the 2004 hit song “[Accidentally in Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Counting+Crows/_/Accidentally+in+Love)”, which was featured on the Shrek 2 soundtrack (that has sold over 1,000,000 copies). That song has also garnered nominations for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. That same year, the band released their first ever best of set, which they titled ‘_Films about Ghosts_’. That album features songs from every phase of the Counting Crows’ recording career. To date, the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.

"Metallica is an American metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California, United States when drummer Lars Ulrich posted an advertisement in The Recycler. Metallica’s line-up originally consisted of Ulrich, rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine was later fired due to problems with alcoholism and drug addiction - he went on to form the band Megadeth. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett took his place. Metallica has been through several bassists, including Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus crash while the band was on tour), and Jason Newsted. The current bassist is Robert Trujillo, who joined in 2003.      Metallica’s early releases included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them as one of the “big four” of the thrash metal sub-genre alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with the 1986 release Master of Puppets described as one of the most influential and “heavy” metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience.      In 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band’s copyright-protected material for free without the band members’ consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay- to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the “steel-sounding” snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger.      Metallica has released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, twenty- two music videos, and forty-four singles. The band has won nine Grammy Awards, and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the only band ever to do so. The band’s 1991 album, Metallica, has sold over 15 million copies in the United States, and 22 million copies worldwide, which makes it the 25th-highest-selling album in the country. The band has sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide as of the release of their latest album Death Magnetic. As of September 2008, Metallica is the fourth highest-selling music artist since the SoundScan era began tracking sales on May 25, 1991, selling a total of 51,136,000 albums in the United States alone.      Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Metallica organised a brand new festival. They called it Sonishpere. Several cities in Europe were chosen by the band.

"Conway Twitty (1 September 1933 – 5 June 1993), born Harold Lloyd Jenkins, was one of the United States’ most successful artists of the 20th century. Twitty had the most singles (55) reach Number 1 on various national music charts. Conway Twitty’s across the board totals were greater than that of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, and Garth Brooks. Most notably known as a country music singer, Twitty also enjoyed success in early Rock and Roll, R&B, and Pop music (among other genres). He teamed up with Loretta Lynn to form one of country music’s most successful business partnerships.         Origin of Jenkins Stage Name————- Jenkins felt that his real name wasn’t marketable, and he changed his show business name in 1957. (Harold Lloyd Jenkins would always remain his legal name, however). Looking at a road map, he spotted Conway, Arkansas and Twitty, Texas. Thus, he went with the professional name of “Conway Twitty”.[citation needed]      Alternatively, Jenkins met a Richmond, VA, man named W. Conway Twitty Jr. through Jenkins’ manager in a New York City restaurant. The manager served in the army with the real Conway Twitty. Later, the manager suggested to Jenkins that he take the name as his stage name because it had a ring to it. The Richmond Conway Twitty subsequently recorded the song, “What’s in a Name But Trouble,” in the mid-1960s, lamenting the loss of his name to Jenkins. The flip side of the 45 RPM record was “The Purple, Purple People Eater, Eater.” (The more well known version of Purple People Eater, however, now having sold over 100,000,000 copies, was recorded by Sheb Wooley.)

"Tammy Wynette (May 5, 1942 – April 6, 1998) was an American country singer and songwriter. She was known as the “First Lady of Country Music” and one of her best-known songs was “Stand by Your Man,” which was one of the biggest selling hit singles by a woman in the history of the music genre. Tammy Wynette was born Virginia Wynette Pugh near Tremont, Mississippi, the only child of William Hollis Pugh (died February 13, 1943) and Mildred Faye Russell (1922–1991). She was always called Wynette (pronounced Win-net), or Nettie, instead of Virginia.      Her father was a farmer and local musician. He died of a brain tumor when Wynette was nine months of age. Her mother worked in an office, as a substitute school teacher, as well as on the family farm. After the death of Hollis Pugh, she left Wynette in the care of her parents, Thomas Chester and Flora A. Russell, and moved to Memphis to work in a World War II defense plant. In 1946, she married Foy Lee, a farmer from Mississippi.      Wynette was raised on the Itawamba County farm of her maternal grandparents where she was born. The place was partly on the border with Alabama. She has often claimed that the state line ran right through their property. she jokingly said “my top half came from Alabama and my bottom half came from Mississippi” As a youngster, she worked in the fields picking cotton alongside the hired crews to get in the crop. She grew up with her aunt, Carolyn Russell, who was only five years older than she was. Wynette sang gospel tunes with her grandmother, learned to play the piano and the guitar.      As a child and teenager, country music provided an escape from her hard life. Wynette grew up idolizing Hank Williams, Skeeter Davis, Patsy Cline, and George Jones and would play their records over and over on the inexpensive children’s record player she owned, dreaming of one day being a star herself.      Tammy Wynette’s 1969 Greatest Hits collection was the first album by a female country artist to sell over one million copies.      She attended Tremont High School, where she was an all-star basketball player. A month before graduation, she married her first husband. He was a construction worker and they moved several times. Her early jobs included working as a waitress, a receptionist, a barmaid, and in a shoe factory. In 1963, she attended beauty school in Tupelo, Mississippi, and became a hairdresser; she would renew her cosmetology license every year for the rest of her life, just in case she should have to go back to a daily job. Her first husband, whom she left before the birth of their third daughter, was not supportive of her ambition to become a country singer, and, is said by Wynette to have told her, “Dream on, Baby.”      Her baby developed spinal meningitis and Wynette tried to make extra money by performing at night. In 1965, Wynette sang on the Country Boy Eddie Show on WBRC-TV in Birmingham, Alabama, which led to some appearances with Porter Wagoner",244405,country,"['country', 'country dawn', 'country gospel', 'cowboy western', 'nashville sound', 'outlaw country', 'traditional country']",tammy wynette,55,"['Stand By Your Man', 'Stand By Your Man', 'D-I-V-O-R-C-E', 'Golden Ring - Single Version', 'Tammy Wynette Kind Of Pain', 'Golden Ring', 'Take Me', 'Two Story House', ""I Don't Wanna Play House"", 'D-I-V-O-R-C-E']"
"Blind Willie McTell (born William Samuel McTier; May 5, 1898 – August 19, 1959) was a Piedmont and ragtime blues singer and guitarist. He played with a fluid, syncopated fingerstyle guitar technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues, although, unlike his contemporaries, he came to use twelve- string guitars exclusively. McTell was also an adept slide guitarist, unusual among ragtime bluesmen. His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back tenor, differed greatly from many of the harsher voice types employed by Delta bluesmen, such as Charley Patton. McTell embodied a variety of musical styles, including blues, ragtime, religious music and hokum.      Born in the town of Thomson, Georgia, McTell learned how to play guitar in his early teens. He soon became a street performer around several Georgia cities including Atlanta and Augusta, and first recorded in 1927 for Victor Records. Although he never produced a major hit record, McTell’s recording career was prolific, recording for different labels under different names throughout the 1920s and 30s. In 1940, he was recorded by folklorist John A. Lomax and Ruby Terrill Lomax for the Library of Congress’s folk song archive. He would remain active throughout the 1940s and 50s, playing on the streets of Atlanta, often with his longtime associate, Curley Weaver. Twice more he recorded professionally. McTell’s last recordings originated during an impromptu session recorded by an Atlanta record store owner in 1956. McTell would die three years later after suffering for years from diabetes and alcoholism. Despite his mainly failed releases, McTell was one of the few archaic blues musicians that would actively play and record during the 1940s and 50s. However, McTell never lived to be “rediscovered” during the imminent American folk music revival, as many other bluesmen would.      McTell’s influence extended over a wide variety of artists, including The Allman Brothers Band, who famously covered McTell’s “Statesboro Blues”, and Bob Dylan, who paid tribute to McTell in his 1983 song “Blind Willie McTell”; the refrain of which is, “And I know no one can sing the blues, like Blind Willie McTell”. Other artists influenced by McTell include Taj Mahal, Alvin Youngblood Hart, Ralph McTell, Chris Smither and The White Stripes.      Born William Samuel McTier in Thomson, Georgia, blind in one eye, McTell had lost his remaining vision by late childhood. He attended schools for the blind in the states of Georgia, New York and Michigan and showed proficiency in music from an early age, first playing harmonica and accordion, learning to read and write music in Braille, and turning to the six-string guitar in his early teens. His family background was rich in music, both of his parents and an uncle played guitar; he is also a relation of bluesman and gospel pioneer Thomas A.

"Samuel George “Sammy” Davis, Jr. (born December 8, 1925 in Harlem, New York; died May 16, 1990 in Beverly Hills, California) was a Grammy Award winning singer, Golden Globe and Emmy Award winning actor, dancer, multi- instrumentalist and only black member of [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra)’s [The Rat Pack](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rat+Pack). Davis began his career with his father and uncle in the [Will Mastin Trio](http://www.last.fm/music/Will+Mastin+Trio) and he toured nationally with them, only leaving due to military service. He became an overnight sensation following a nightclub performance at Ciro’s after the 1951 Academy Awards, became a successful recording artist and then made his first film performances later that decade.      Davis, Jr. was born in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, New York, to Elvera Sanchez, a dancer, and Sammy Davis, Sr., an African-American entertainer. The couple were both dancers in vaudeville. As an infant, he was raised by his paternal grandmother. When he was three years old, his parents split up. His father, not wanting to lose custody of his son, took him on tour. Sammy Davis Jr. claimed that his mother was Puerto Rican, however the 2003 biography In Black and White alleges that he made this claim due to the political sensitivities of the 1960s (during the Cuban Missile Crisis), and that his mother was born in New York of Cuban descent rather than in San Juan, Puerto Rico.      As a child he learned how to dance from his father, Sammy Davis, Sr., and his “uncle” Will Mastin, who led the dance troupe his father worked for. Davis joined the act as a young child in 1928 and they became the Will Mastin Trio. Throughout his long career, Davis included the Will Mastin Trio in his billing.      Mastin and his father had shielded him from racism. Snubs were explained as jealousy. But during World War II, Davis served in the United States Army, where he was first confronted by strong racial prejudice. As he said later, “Overnight the world looked different. It wasn’t one color anymore. I could see the protection I’d gotten all my life from my father and Will. I appreciated their loving hope that I’d never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I’d walked through a swinging door for eighteen years, a door which they had always secretly held open.

"OutKast is an American [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) duo from Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Over 25 million copies have been sold of Outkast’s seven releases: six studio albums—including one double album—and a greatest hits release.      The group’s original musical style was a mixture of Dirty South and G-Funk. Since then funk, soul, pop, electronic music, rock, spoken word poetry, jazz, and blues have been added to the group’s musical palette. The duo consists of Atlanta native André “[Andre 3000](http://www.last.fm/music/Andre+3000)” Benjamin (formerly known as Dré) and Georgia-born Antwan “[Big Boi](http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Boi)” Patton.      Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is one of only four hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond in the U.S. for shipping over 10 million units. Along with Outkast’s commercial success, they have maintained an experimental approach in their music and are widely praised for their originality and artistic content.      Benjamin and Patton met while attending Tri-Cities High School, a Visual and Performing Arts School. Benjamin’s parents were divorced and he was living with his father. Meanwhile, Patton had to move with his four brothers and six sisters from Savannah to Atlanta. Benjamin and Patton eventually teamed up and were pursued by Organized Noize, a group of local producers who would later make hits for TLC. The duo initially wanted to be called “2 Shades Deep” or “The Misfits”, but because those names were already taken they later decided to use “OutKast” based on finding “outcast” as synonym for “misfit” in a dictionary. OutKast, Organized Noize, and schoolmates Goodie Mob formed the nucleus of the Dungeon Family organization.      OutKast signed to LaFace Records in 1992, becoming the label’s first hip hop act and making their first appearance on the remix of label mate TLC’s “What About Your Friends”. In 1993, they released their first single, “Player’s Ball”. The song’s funky style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences. “Player’s Ball” hit number-one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart.      Their debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was issued on April 26th, 1994. This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many hip hop aficionados. Every track on Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was produced by Organized Noize and featured other members of the Dungeon Family. Follow-up singles included the title track and “Git Up Git Out”, a politically charged collaboration with Goodie Mob that was later sampled by Macy Gray for her 1999 hit “Do Something.” On this early material, both André and Big Boi contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of pimps and gangsters with politically conscious material commenting on the status of African Americans in the South",1172069,blues,"['atl hip hop', 'dirty south rap', 'hip hop', 'pop rap', 'rap', 'southern hip hop']",outkast,76,"['Hey Ya!', 'Ms. Jackson', 'Roses', 'The Way You Move (feat.

"Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969 in Brooklyn, New York, United States), is an American rapper and former president and CEO of Roc A Fella Records. He is more commonly known by a variety of stage names including Jay-Z, S. Carter, Jigga, Hova, J-Hova, Hov, and Young Hov. He is regarded as one of the most prolific and successful American blend artists of the mid-90s and early 2000s and is known for his use of metaphors, freestyling abilities, word play, flow, and blending of street and popular hip hop. He is one of the most respected rappers in the music industry, and is admired for his ability to craft songs from memory without the use of pen and paper. He married his long time girlfriend [Beyonce](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Beyonce) in April 2008 after dating for over seven years. He is one of the founders of Roc-A-Fella Records, a hip-hop record label which also launched the careers of artists such as [Beanie Sigel](http://www.last.fm/music/Beanie+Sigel), [Kanye West](http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West), [Memphis Bleek](http://www.last.fm/music/Memphis+Bleek), [Young Gunz](http://www.last.fm/music/Young+Gunz), [Freeway](http://www.last.fm/music/Freeway), and [Teairra Mari](http://www.last.fm/music/Teairra+Mari).      **Early history**   Originally from the infamous Marcy Houses projects in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in [brooklyn](http://www.last.fm/tag/brooklyn) in New York City, Shawn Carter was abandoned by his father Adnes Reeves when he was only twelve years old and he was consequently raised by his mother Gloria Carter. Jay-Z attended George Westinghouse High School in Downtown Brooklyn and Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey but did not graduate. He claims to have been caught up in selling drugs on the streets of New York in the Marcy Projects. In addition to this, Jay-Z has lyrically alluded to having sold crack cocaine and marijuana in Virginia and Maryland.      According to his mother, a young Jay-Z used to keep his siblings up at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a boombox for his birthday and thus sparked his interest in music. He began freestyling, writing rhymes, and followed the music of many artists popular at the time.      In his neighborhood, Carter was known as “Jazzy,” a nickname which eventually developed into his stage name, “Jay-Z.” The moniker is also a homage to his musical partner [Lee Dub](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Dub) ([www.soundclick.com/kingdeezy](http://www.soundclick.com/kingdeezy)) [Jaz-O](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaz-O) (a.k.a.

"Rage Against the Machine is an American [rap metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/rap%20metal) band, formed in 1991 in Los Angeles, California. The band’s line-up comprises vocalist [Zack De La Rocha](http://www.last.fm/music/Zack+De+La+Rocha), guitarist [Tom Morello](http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Morello), bassist [Tim Commerford](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Commerford) and drummer Brad Wilk.

In 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band’s third album The Battle of Los Angeles was released in 1999. During their initial nine year run, they became one of the most popular and influential [political](http://www.last.fm/tag/political) bands in contemporary music.      Shortly after breaking up in 2000, the band released the cover album Renegades. De la Rocha & Morello both started low-key solo careers; the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup [Audioslave](http://www.last.fm/music/Audioslave) with [Chris Cornell](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Cornell), then-former frontman of [Soundgarden](http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden), which disbanded in 2007, and in April of that year, Rage Against the Machine performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band has continued to perform at many live venues and festivals around the world since 2007 but have not recorded any new studio material, as of yet.      Due to a popular Facebook Campaign in 2009, the band managed to beat [Joe McElderry](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+McElderry), winner of the X Factor 2009, to the UK Christmas number one spot.

"**Coal Chamber** is a [nu metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/nu%20metal) band from Los Angeles, CA, USA formed in 1993. They enjoyed some mainstream success in the mid to late 90’s during the _nu metal boom_ which they, along with bands like [KoЯn](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ko%D0%AFn) helped create. The band gained a large following early in their career, arguably because they were one of the first ‘darker’ themed [nu metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/nu%20metal) bands.      Coal Chamber signed to Roadrunner Records and recorded their first album (both in 1996) for their self-titled debut in 1997. The album was released to critical praise, especially for the first single Loco, a track that many fans consider the bands finest work.      Their next album was released in fall of 1999 entitled Chamber Music. This album was considered a step away from the nu metal image they had engendered with their prior release, having instead a more gothic metal inspired feel. On this album also was a cover of a song originally done by Peter Gabriel in 1982 called “Shock The Monkey” with legendary rocker, Ozzy Osbourne, providing vocals in collaboration with the band’s lead singer, Dez Fafara.      The band followed up with their third album Dark Days in the spring of 2002, which met with mixed reviews. Bassist Rayna Foss-Rose had left the band to raise her daughter before the album was recorded; she was replaced by Nadja Peulen, who had taken Foss-Rose’s place during her pregnancy between the first two albums. Rayna had a falling out of sorts with frontman Dez Fafara saying that she and her husband had “found Christ” and would be leaving Coal Chamber for good.      Late summer 2003, saw the release of a compilation album titled Giving The Devil His Due, which included several demo tracks submitted by the band prior to their signing with Roadrunner Records in 1997, along with several alternate studio recordings and remixes of various tracks from their previous releases. Coal Chamber disbanded in 2003, shortly after lead vocalist Dez Fafara left to form the Hard Rock turned Melodic Death Metal group [DevilDriver](http://www.last.fm/music/DevilDriver).      In June 2005, Fafara stated that Coal Chamber’s hiatus is permanent and will not be reforming at any time in the future. However, in September 2011, it was announced that Fafara, Cox and Rascón would reform the band with bassist Chela Rhea Harper, to play the Soundwave shows in Australia.

"**Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen** (born September 23, 1949 in Freehold, New Jersey, United States) is an American songwriter, singer, and guitarist. With a recording career stretching back to 1966 that continues to this day, he’s recorded multiple award-winning studio albums and toured constantly, inspiring generations of [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) and [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) musicians. He’s often known as “The Boss”.       He has frequently played as [Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen+&+The+E+Street+Band). Most widely known for his brand of [heartland rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/heartland%20rock) infused with [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) hooks, poetic lyrics, and [americana](http://www.last.fm/tag/americana) sentiments, he often sings songs centered around his native New Jersey. Initially inspired by the tuneful songwriting of [british invasion](http://www.last.fm/tag/british%20invasion) music as well as the vocal swagger of [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley), his eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including twenty Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. He has sold over 70 million releases in the U.S. alone.      Springsteen’s lyrics often concern men and women struggling to make ends meet. In this sense he was sometimes compared to [Woody Guthrie](http://www.last.fm/music/Woody+Guthrie) and other popular [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) artists. He has gradually become more and more identified with progressive politics, particularly working-class pride. Springsteen is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, on which his album _[The Rising](http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/The+Rising)_ reflects.      Springsteen’s recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll) albums, often inspired by contemporary [pop rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop%20rock), and somber [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk)-oriented works. Much of his iconic status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, among which Springsteen intersperses long, whimsical tales or deeply emotional stories alongside numerous jokes and asides.      Springsteen has long had the nickname “The Boss,” a term which he was initially reported to dislike but now seems to have come to terms with, as he sometimes jokingly refers to himself as such on stage. The nickname originated when a young Springsteen, playing club gigs with a band in the 1960s, took on the task of collecting the band’s nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates",2489010,rock,"['heartland rock', 'mellow gold', 'permanent wave', 'rock', 'singer-songwriter']",bruce springsteen,78,"['Born to Run', 'Dancing In the Dark', 'Born in the U.S.A.', ""I'm On Fire"", 'Glory Days', 'Thunder Road', 'Hungry Heart', 'Streets of Philadelphia - Single Edit', 'Badlands', 'The River']"
"**The Doors** were an American [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band which formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1965. The band consisted of [Jim Morrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Morrison) (vocals), [Ray Manzarek](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Manzarek) (organ), [Robby Krieger](http://www.last.fm/music/Robby+Krieger) (guitar) and [John Densmore](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Densmore) (drums). In this configuration, the band released six albums, all of which were successful and released two US #1 hit singles - 1967’s “Light My Fire” and 1968’s “Hello, I Love You”. After Morrison’s death at his apartment at 17 Rue Beautraillis Paris in 1971, the band continued on as a trio, releasing two more albums that were ignored commercially and disliked critically before disbanding in 1973.      UCLA film school students [Jim Morrison](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Morrison) and [Ray Manzarek](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Manzarek) had known each other at college and met by chance on Venice beach in July 1965. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs and, at Manzarek’s encouragement, sang “Moonlight Drive”. Manzarek immediately suggested they form a band.      Keyboardist Ray Manzarek was already in the band called [Rick And The Ravens](http://www.last.fm/music/Rick+And+The+Ravens) with Morrison and his brother Rick Manzarek while [Robby Krieger](http://www.last.fm/music/Robby+Krieger) and [John Densmore](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Densmore) were playing with The Psychedelic Rangers, and knew Manzarek from shared meditation instruction. In August Densmore joined the group and, along with members of the Ravens and an unidentified female bass player, recorded a six-song demo on September 2. This was widely bootlegged and appeared in full on the [1997](http://www.last.fm/tag/1997) Doors box set.      That month the group recruited talented guitarist Robby Krieger and the final lineup—Morrison, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore—was complete. Manzarek solved their lack of bassist by playing bass on a Fender Rhodes bass keyboard with his left hand and keyboards with his right hand.      The band took their name from the title of a book by [Aldous Huxley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley), [The Doors of Perception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_of_Perception), which was in turn borrowed from a line of poetry by the 18th century artist and poet [William Blake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake): “If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite.”      By 1966 the group was playing The London Fog club and soon graduated to the prestigious Whisky a Go Go. On August 10 they were spotted by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman on the insistence of [Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Love) singer [Arthur Lee](http://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+Lee), whose group was on Elektra.

"Gene Krupa (January 15, 1909 – October 16, 1973) was a famous and influential American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) and [big band](http://www.last.fm/tag/big%20band) drummer, known for his highly energetic and flamboyant style.      Many consider Krupa to be one of the most influential drummers of the 20th century, particularly regarding the development of the drum kit. Many jazz historians believe he made history in 1927 as the first kit drummer ever to record using a bass drum pedal. His drum method was published in 1938 and immediately became the standard text. He is also credited with inventing the rim shot on the snare drum. Rhythm, the UK’s best selling drum magazine voted Gene Krupa the third most influential drummer ever, in a poll conducted for its February 2009 issue. Voters included over 50 top-name drummers      Krupa was born Eugene Bertram Krupa to Polish parents in Chicago, Illinois. He began playing professionally in the mid 1920s with bands in Wisconsin. He broke into the Chicago scene in 1927, when he was picked by MCA to become a member of “Thelma Terry and Her Playboys”, the first notable American Jazz band (outside of all-girl bands) to be led by a female musician. The Playboys were the house band at The Golden Pumpkin nightclub in Chicago and also toured extensively throughout the eastern and central United States.      Krupa made his first recordings in 1927, with a band under the leadership of banjoist Eddie Condon and “fixer” (and sometime singer, who did not appear on the records), Red McKenzie: along with other recordings beginning in 1924 by musicians known in the “Chicago” scene such as Bix Beiderbecke, these sides are examples of white “Chicago Style” jazz. The numbers recorded at that session were: ‘China Boy’, ‘Sugar’, ‘Nobody’s Sweetheart’ and ‘Liza’. The McKenzie - Condon sides are also notable for being the first records to feature a full drum kit.      In 1929 he moved to New York City and worked with the band of Red Nichols. In 1934 he joined Benny Goodman’s band, where his featured drum work — especially on the hit “Sing, Sing, Sing” — made him a national celebrity. In 1938, after a public fight with Goodman at the Earl Theater in Philadelphia, he left Goodman to launch his own band and had several hits with singer Anita O’Day and trumpeter Roy Eldridge. Krupa made a memorable cameo appearance in the 1941 film Ball of Fire, in which he and his band performed an extended version of the hit Drum Boogie.

"Chester Arthur Burnett (June 10, 1910 in White Station, Mississippi, United States – January 10, 1976 in Hines, Illinois, United States), known as Howlin’ Wolf, was an influential American [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) singer, guitarist and harmonica player.      With a booming voice and looming physical presence, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared, “no one could match Howlin’ Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits.” A number of songs written or popularized by Burnett—such as “Smokestack Lightnin’”, “Back Door Man”, “Killing Floor” and “Spoonful”—have become blues and blues rock standards.      At 6 feet, 6 inches (198 cm) and close to 300 pounds (136 kg), he was an imposing presence with one of the loudest and most memorable voices of all the “classic” 1950s Chicago blues singers. This rough-edged, slightly fearsome musical style is often contrasted with the less crude but still powerful presentation of his contemporary and professional rival, Muddy Waters. Howlin’ Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller), Little Walter Jacobs, and Muddy Waters are usually regarded in retrospect as the greatest blues artists who recorded for Chess in Chicago. Sam Phillips once remarked, “When I heard Howlin’ Wolf, I said, ‘This is for me. This is where the soul of man never dies.’” In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him #51 on their list of the “100 Greatest Artists of All Time”.      Burnett died at Hines VA Hospital in Hines, Illinois on January 10, 1976 and was buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery, Hillside, Cook County, Illinois in a plot in Section 18, on the east side of the road. His large gravestone, allegedly purchased by Eric Clapton, has an image of a guitar and harmonica etched into it.      The Howlin’ Wolf Memorial Blues Festival is held each year in West Point, Mississippi. Wolf’s Juke Joint Jam is another annual Howlin’ Wolf tribute festival held in West Point. Some of the artists who have played ‘Wolf Jam’ include Wolf’s lead guitarist Hubert Sumlin, Muddy Waters’ back band of Willie “Big Eyes” Smith, Calvin “Fuzz” Jones and “Steady Rollin” Bob Margolin, Willie King, Blind Mississippi Morris, Kenny Brown, Burnside Exploration, etc. The festival is held at the 500-acre (2.0 km2) festival grounds known as Waverly Waters Resort.      A popular music venue in New Orleans, Louisiana was named The Howlin’ Wolf when it opened in 1988.      Burnett was portrayed by Eamonn Walker in the 2008 motion picture Cadillac Records.

"**Spineshank** is a Los Angeles, CA, USA Grammy-nominated alternative metal band.      Began in February of 1996, rising from the ashes of a previous band, Basic Enigma (which included future Spineshank members Jonny Santos on vocals, Mike Sarkisyan on guitars, and Tom Decker on drums). Basic Enigma broke up but soon reformed with a different sound and moniker, and a new bassist (Robert Garcia).      The band soon befriended Fear Factory guitarist Dino Cazares, who upon hearing their demo, offered the new band to open a show for F.F. at the Whiskey A-Go- Go in Los Angeles. This led to other coveted opening slots (with such popular acts as [Coal Chamber](http://www.last.fm/music/Coal+Chamber), [Snot](http://www.last.fm/music/Snot), [Soulfly](http://www.last.fm/music/Soulfly), [Sepultura](http://www.last.fm/music/Sepultura) and [Danzig](http://www.last.fm/music/Danzig), among others), and label interest, with Roadrunner eventually signing the band. Their debut, [Strictly Diesel](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/Strictly+Diesel), was released in September of 1998, and featured yet another tie-in with their favorite band, Fear Factory vocalist Burton C. Bell sings on the track [Stain](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/_/Stain). [The Height of Callousness](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/The+Height+of+Callousness) followed two years later.

The band would hold a second stage slot on Ozzfest 2001 for the majority of that summer as well as touring with the likes of [Disturbed](http://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed), [(hed) p.e.](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/\(hed\)+p.e.), [Orgy](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgy)& [Mudvayne](http://www.last.fm/music/Mudvayne).      2003 saw the release of the much anticipated [Self Destructive Pattern](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/Self+Destructive+Pattern), as well as the single [Smothered](http://www.last.fm/music/Spineshank/_/Smothered).

"Kitty Wells (born Muriel Deason on 30 August 1919 - 16 July 2012) is a country singer from Nashville, Tennessee, known as the Queen of Country Music. During the 1950s she was the only female vocalist to consistently hit the top of the country charts and her stardom was on the same level as the biggest male vocalists of the period.      Wells’ success in the 1950s and 1960s was so enormous that she still ranks as the sixth most successful female vocalist in the history of the Billboard country charts according to historian Joel Whitburn’s book “The Top 40 Country Hits”, behind Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, Tammy Wynette, and Tanya Tucker. Wells was the third country music artist, behind Roy Acuff and Hank Williams, to receive the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1991 as well as being the seventh woman and first Caucasian woman to receive the honor. In 1976, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

"Nehemiah Curtis “Skip” James (June 21, 1902 – October 3, 1969) was an American blues singer, guitarist, pianist and songwriter.      Early years      James was born near Bentonia, Mississippi. As a youth, he heard local musicians such as Henry Stuckey and brothers Charlie and Jesse Sims and began playing the organ in his teens. He worked on road construction and levee- building crews in his native Mississippi in the early 1920s, and wrote what is perhaps his earliest song, “Illinois Blues”, about his experiences as a laborer. Later in the ’20s he sharecropped and made bootleg whiskey in the Bentonia area. He began playing guitar in open D-minor tuning and developed a three-finger picking technique that he would use to great effect on his recordings. In addition, he began to practice piano-playing, drawing inspiration from the Mississippi blues pianist Little Brother Montgomery.         1920s and ’30s      In early 1931 James auditioned for the Jackson, Mississippi record shop owner and talent scout H. C. Speir, who placed blues performers with a variety of record labels including Paramount Records. On the strength of this audition, Skip James traveled to Grafton, Wisconsin to record for Paramount. These recordings are among the most famous and idiosyncratic ever made in the blues idiom.      “I’m So Glad” was derived from a 1927 song by Art Sizemore and George A. Little entitled “So Tired”, which had been recorded by both Gene Austin and, as “I’m Tired of Livin’ All Alone”, by Lonnie Johnson. But as James’ biographer, Stephen Calt, maintains, the finished product was totally original, “one of the most extraordinary examples of fingerpicking found in guitar music.” The other pieces recorded at Grafton, such as “Devil Got My Woman”, “Special Rider Blues” and “22-20”, were of similarly high quality both vocally and instrumentally and are the recordings upon which James’ subsequent reputation lay. Very few copies of James’ Paramount 78s now exist. “Devil Got My Woman” was featured in the 2001 film Ghost World.      “Disappearance” and “rediscovery”      For the next thirty years, James recorded nothing and drifted in and out of music. He was virtually unknown to listeners until about 1960. In 1964 blues enthusiasts John Fahey, Bill Barth and Henry Vestine found him in Tunica, Mississippi. According to Calt, the “rediscovery” of both Skip James and of Son House at virtually the same moment was the start of the “blues revival” in America. In July 1964 James, along with other blues performers, appeared at the Newport Folk Festival. He recorded for the Takoma, Melodeon and Vanguard labels and played engagements throughout the remainder of the decade. Cream recorded two versions of “I’m So Glad” (a studio version and a live version), providing James the only windfall of his career. (Cream based their version on James’ simplifed ’60s recording, not on the original 1931 recording.)

"Bessie Smith (April 15, 1894 – September 26, 1937) was an American blues singer.   Nicknamed The Empress of the Blues, Smith was the most popular female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s. She is often regarded as one of the greatest singers of her era and, along with Louis Armstrong, a major influence on other jazz vocalists.      The 1900 census indicates that Bessie Smith was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 1892. However, the 1910 census recorded her birthday as April 15, 1894, a date that appears on all subsequent documents and was observed by the entire Smith family. Census data also contributes to controversy about the size of her family. The 1870 and 1880 censuses report three older half-siblings, while later interviews with Smith’s family and contemporaries did not include these individuals among her siblings.      Bessie Smith was the daughter of Laura (née Owens) and William Smith. William Smith was a laborer and part-time Baptist preacher (he was listed in the 1870 census as a “minister of the gospel”, in Moulton, Lawrence, Alabama.) He died before his daughter could remember him. By the time she was nine, she had lost her mother and a brother as well. Her older sister Viola took charge of caring for her siblings.      To earn money for their impoverished household, Bessie Smith and her brother Andrew began busking on the streets of Chattanooga as a duo: she singing and dancing, he accompanying her on guitar. Their favorite location was in front of the White Elephant Saloon at Thirteenth and Elm streets in the heart of the city’s African-American community.      In 1904, her oldest brother, Clarence, covertly left home, joining a small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes. “If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,” said Clarence’s widow, Maud. “That’s why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.”      In 1912, Clarence returned to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe. He arranged for its managers, Lonnie and Cora Fisher, to give Smith an audition. She was hired as a dancer rather than a singer, because the company also included the unknown singer, Ma Rainey. Smith eventually moved on to performing in various chorus lines, making the “81” Theater in Atlanta her home base. There were times when she worked in shows on the black-owned T.O.B.A (Theater Owners Booking Association) circuit. She would rise to become its biggest star after signing with Columbia Records.      By 1923, when she began her recording career, Smith had taken up residence in Philadelphia. There she met and fell in love with Jack Gee, a security guard whom she married on June 7, 1923, just as her first record was released. During the marriage—a stormy one, with infidelity on both sides—Smith became the highest paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own railroad car",90575,blues,"['blues', 'jazz blues', 'traditional blues', 'vocal jazz']",bessie smith,44,"[""Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out"", 'Bessie Smith', ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out"", 'Moaners', ""Devil's Gonna Git You"", ""Dirty No-Gooder's Blues"", ""Baby Won't You Please Come Home"", ""Aggravatin' Papa"", 'Empty Bed Blues, Pt. 1', 'Downhearted Blues']"
"**Queen** were an English rock band originally consisting of four members: vocalist [Freddie Mercury](http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Mercury), guitarist [Brian May](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+May), bass guitarist [John Deacon](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Deacon), and drummer [Roger Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Taylor).      The band formed in London in 1970 after May and Taylor’s former band [Smile](http://www.last.fm/music/Smile) split after having released an album and single. Freddie replaced lead vocalist [Tim Staffell](http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Staffell), after the latter’s departure from the original trio.      There was much deliberation as to what the band’s name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books _Out Of The Silent Planet._      Ultimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie’s. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was “right” for the band.      _”Years ago I thought up the name Queen… It’s just a name, but it’s very regal, and it sounds splendid. It’s a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. “_   \- Freddie Mercury.      Queen went through several bass players before a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971.      _”Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they’d look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn’t play._ \- Brian May.      _This quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right._” - Brian May.      Later that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - [Liar](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Liar), [Keep Yourself Alive](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Keep+Yourself+Alive), [Jesus](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Jesus), and [The Night Comes Down](http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/The+Night+Comes+Down). The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors.      It was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie",19498221,rock,"['glam rock', 'rock']",queen,90,"['Bohemian Rhapsody - Remastered 2011', ""Don't Stop Me Now - Remastered"", 'Another One Bites The Dust - Remastered 2011', 'Dancing Queen', 'Trap Queen', 'Queen of Mean', 'Dark Queen', 'Under Pressure - Remastered', 'homecoming queen?', 'We Will Rock You - Remastered']"
"Carmen Mercedes McRae (1920-1994) was a U.S. jazz singer, songwriter, and pianist.      McRae was born in Harlem, New York, on the 8th April 1920, and studied piano as a child. As a teenager she came to the attention of Teddy Wilson and his wife, the composer Irene Kitchings Wilson. Through their influence, one of McRae’s early songs, “Dream of Life”, was recorded by Wilson’s longtime collaborator Billie Holiday.      By the late 1940s she was well known among the modern jazz musicians who gathered at Minton’s Playhouse, Harlem’s most famous jazz club, where she was the intermission pianist. But it was while working in Brooklyn that she came to the attention of Decca’s Milt Gabler. Her five year association with Decca yielded twelve LPs.      The musicians she sang with include Benny Carter, Mercer Ellington, Count Basie, Sammy Davis Jr, Dave Brubeck, and Louis Armstrong. She was married once (and briefly), to drummer Kenny Clarke.

"**Morcheeba** are a British band that mixes influences from [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock), [trip hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/trip%20hop), [rhythm and blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/rhythm%20and%20blues) and [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop). The word “morcheeba” means “the way of marijuana” (“MOR” - the middle of the road & “Cheeba” - informal name for cannabis).      Formed in 1995, they consisted of [Paul Godfrey](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Godfrey) ([dj](http://www.last.fm/tag/dj)), [Ross Godfrey](http://www.last.fm/music/Ross+Godfrey) on guitar and keyboards with [Skye Edwards](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Skye+Edwards) as the primary vocalist fronting the band. While churning up interest through an underground presence mostly in London, the band finally broke through when featured on the Ultra-Chilled series.      Their first two releases seemed to portend a trip-hop based modern psychedelia that they seemed to completely eschew for a meatier, beatier, mom pop-centric sound on 2000’s _[Fragments of Freedom](http://www.last.fm/music/Morcheeba/Fragments+of+Freedom)_. This completely confounded some fans and critics who immediately wrote them off — many of whom would later return and eat their words. The band took another big turn in 2005 with _[The Antidote](http://www.last.fm/music/Morcheeba/The+Antidote)_.      [Daisy Martey](http://www.last.fm/music/Daisy+Martey) (formerly of the band [Noonday Underground](http://www.last.fm/music/Noonday+Underground)) joined in 2005 to succeed Skye Edwards. In 2003 the Godfrey brothers made the decision to part with Skye and asked her to leave Morcheeba, she went on to pursue a solo career. However, as Skye Edwards and her voice had become a very integral part of the Morcheeba sound in the minds of many of the band’s fans, the rather abrupt switch to a new lead singer had met with mixed reactions, including criticisms that the “new” Morcheeba was no longer as electrifying in person. Perhaps because of this, the Godfrey brothers replaced Daisy with yet another singer - Jody Sternberg \- for their live performances.

"Scorpions is a hard rock/heavy metal band from Hannover, Germany, best known for their 1984 rock anthem “Rock You Like a Hurricane” and their singles “Wind of Change”, “No One Like You”, “Still Loving You”, and “Send Me an Angel”. The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide. Along with [Metallica](http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica), [Iron Maiden](http://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden), [AC/DC](http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC), [Kiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Kiss), [Aerosmith](http://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith), [Ozzy Osbourne](http://www.last.fm/music/Ozzy+Osbourne) and [Deep Purple](http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple) they are one of the most successful hard rock/heavy metal acts and by far the most successful German Rock band in America and England. Rudolf Schenker, the band’s rhythm guitarist, explained in an [interview with Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7230): “In the beginning of our career, we had a problem in Germany because nobody expects a German band to play Rock music. With Rock music, there are more bands from England or America, which are more exotic than the Scorpions, who are from Germany. But when we went to America in ‘79, we became the exotic ones. They said, ‘Hey, what kind of crazy guys are these?’ (laughs) We were already exotic, with a different view, and we also play our Rock music with a little bit of an ethnic touch. You’ll notice that Americans come from the blues side, whereas we come from the classical side, which is different.”      \+ The “Scorps” known to metal heads of the time, reminisce more of Lonesome Crow · Fly to the Rainbow · In Trance · Virgin Killer · Taken by Force · Lovedrive · Animal Magnetism. Only after the commercial success of “Blackout” did they start to get heavily pushed into the mainstream media of the U.S. market by Mercury records. Wind of change and Rock you like a Hurricane pushed The Scorps into the Limelight because of the heavy MTV push to please young rockers of the time.   \+   \+ Rock you like a Hurricane was overplayed by MTV because RCA wouldn’t let MTV have any of Scorpions old videos. MTV was the no mans land. They had no money to buy a big video collection of any artists and the owners of MTV got no money/backing of any big studio.   \+   \+ The consensus of the time thought MTV wouldn’t hold a dime to to the already popular television/music shows of the time “Midnight Special, Hee Haw, Soul Train and American Bandstand” and would fade away into the history books.   \+   \+ **Song Origin,**   \+   \+ The song “Rock You Like a Hurricane” was created because Klaus Meine and the band wanted a song that thanked all his fans and the song was a reminder to the band of how all the Scorpions world wide fans made them feel.

"Trevor George Smith Jr. (born May 20, 1972 in Brooklyn, New York), better known by his stage name Busta Rhymes, is an American rapper and actor signed to Universal Motown. He began his rap career in the group [Leaders of the New School](http://www.last.fm/music/Leaders+of+the+New+School), and according to [Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=25246) had his breakout moment when they featured on [A Tribe Called Quest](http://www.last.fm/music/A+Tribe+Called+Quest)’s hit, [Scenario](http://www.last.fm/music/A+Tribe+Called+Quest/_/Scenario). Busta then released his debut album, The Coming, in 1996. He has since released 1997’s When Disaster Strikes, 1998’s E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front, 2000’s Anarchy 2001’s Genesis, 2002’s It Ain’t Safe No More, 2006’s The Big Bang and 2009’s Back on My B.S. His ninth studio album, The Chemo, will be released early 2010 and is said to be 80% completed.      Born to parents Geraldine Green (1947) and Trevor George Smith Sr, and he has a younger brother, Paul Smith. His parents divorced when he 10 years old. Busta’s time during the year of 1983 was that of change, his parents got divorced and his way of thinking was altered, during that year he also changed his religious beliefs and re-named himself ‘Born Justice God Allah’ because of the supreme sorts of names that he now believed in and looked up to. He discovered hip hop music through listening to the Zulu Beats Radio Show, something influenced him from that show and three years later he would form a group. Busta also went to school in the United Kingdom, where he lived in Blackpool, Preston and Morecambe. Ended up graduating from George Westinghouse High School in downtown Brooklyn.   As a youngster he played basketball, football and soccer.      His Panamanian baby-sitter, Aunt Mitzi, made him listen to all the rap radio stations. So, He would sit there at 2 in the morning rapping when he was supposed to be sleeping. I just couldn’t be too loud or Mitzi’s poodle would start dancing around and barking. One night, the poodle barked and Mitzi took my radio away. So he said, “I don’t need that radio. I’ll write my own rap songs.” Busta Rhymes later became part of a B-Boy crew with mainly latinos, a couple of white kids, and Busta, the only black one. When he was about 10 years old after he moved from Brooklyn to Long Island, where he became a member of the crew when it was a big contest happening which the leader of the crew, Johnny Juice watched. Busta just came up to him like, “Are you Johnny Juice?” and Johnny answered like “Yeah.” and he said he wanted to be down with this crew. He started poppin’ and Johnny said he was dope so he said “We’re about to do this contest” and they wanted to put him down with them, but he didn’t know the routines.

"Eiffel 65 is an Italian eurodance group, formed by producers/composers [Jeffrey Jey](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeffrey+Jey) (also vocals), [Maurizio Lobina](http://www.last.fm/music/Maurizio+Lobina) and [Gabry Ponte](http://www.last.fm/music/Gabry+Ponte). All three members are from the city of Turin (Italy). The name of the group came from a random word generator that produced the word “Eiffel”. The “65” was added as a mistake: part of a phone number scribbled on a demo by accident.      Their greatest worldwide success came with their first single “Blue (Da Ba Dee)” from their 1999 album _Europop_. peaking at #1 on the UK and Australian charts, and peaking at #4 on the US charts, followed by “Move Your Body” peaking at #3 in the UK. Their second album _Contact!_ was released in 2001, to moderate success in Europe. Their third self-title album was released in 2003, featuring mostly Italian lyrics. A couple months later a double-disc special edition came out that featured the English versions of the songs as well as a few remixes.      In 2005, Gabry left the group to focus on his solo career. In 2006, Jeffrey and Maurizio left the label Bliss Corporation and together formed the group [Bloom 06](http://www.last.fm/music/Bloom+06). They released two albums, two EPs and several singles.      In June 2010, Massimo Gabutti, managing director of Bliss Corporation, announced the return of Eiffel 65 in its original formation.

"Sidney Bechet (May 14, 1897 – May 14, 1959) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, and composer.   He was one of the first important soloists in jazz (beating cornetist and trumpeter Louis Armstrong to the recording studio by several months and later playing duets with Armstrong), and was perhaps the first notable jazz saxophonist. Forceful delivery, well-constructed improvisations, and a distinctive, wide vibrato characterized Bechet’s playing.   Bechet’s erratic temperament hampered his career, however, and not until the late 1940s did he earn wide acclaim.      Bechet was born in New Orleans on 14th May 1897. From a young age he was able quickly to master any musical instrument he encountered. Some New Orleanians remembered him as a cornet hot-shot in his youth. At first, though, he decided on the clarinet as his main instrument, and Bechet remained one of jazz’s greatest clarinetists for decades. He is, however, perhaps best remembered as the master of the soprano saxophone. Bechet was the first notable jazz saxophonist of any sort, his playing characterised by forceful delivery, well conceived, improvised ideas, and a distinctive wide vibrato.      Bechet had experience playing in travelling shows even before he left New Orleans at the age of twenty. Never long content in one place, he alternated between Chicago, New York, and Europe as his base of operations until finally he settled in France in 1950. He married Elisabeth Ziegler in Antibes, France in 1951.      Bechet successfully composed in jazz, pop, and extended concert work forms. His recordings have often been reissued. Some of the highlights include 1924 sides with [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong) in “Clarence Williams Blue Five”, the 1932, 1940, and 1941 [New Orleans Feetwarmers](http://www.last.fm/music/New+Orleans+Feetwarmers) sides, a 1938 [Tommy Ladnier](http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Ladnier) Orchestra session (“Weary Blues”, “Really the Blues”), and various versions of his own composition, “Petite Fleur”.      In 1941, as an early experiment in overdubbing at RCA Studios, he recorded on six different instruments: the clarinet, soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, piano, bass, and drums. This recording can be heard under the title “Sheik of Araby”.      Shortly before his death in Paris, Bechet dictated his autobiography, _Treat It Gentle_. He died on 14th May 1959 - his sixty-second birthday.      Legacy and honors      Bechet successfully composed in jazz, pop-tune, and extended concert work forms. He knew how to read music but chose not to, due to his highly developed inner ear; he developed his own fingering system and never played section parts in a big band or swing-style combo. His recordings have often been reissued.   Sidney Bechet’s primary instruments were the clarinet and the soprano sax. His playing style is intense and passionate, and had a wide vibrato",63395,jazz,"['bebop', 'big band', 'dixieland', 'jazz', 'jazz clarinet', 'new orleans jazz', 'ragtime', 'stride', 'swing', 'vocal jazz']",sidney bechet,49,"['Si tu vois ma mère - Slow', 'Summertime', 'Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives To Me', 'Petite Fleur', 'Si tu vois ma mère', 'Joshua Fit De Battle of Jericho', 'Blue Horizon', 'Strange Fruit', 'Blame It On The Blues', 'Promenade aux Champs-Elysees']"

Growing up, he was heavily influenced by cutting- edge [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) artist [Herbie Hancock](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock) as well as the more typical DJ heroes like [Grandmaster Flash](http://www.last.fm/music/Grandmaster+Flash), Grand Wizard Theodore, and [DJ Premier](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Premier). After graduating from Baruch College with a degree in psychology, Swift joined one of the top scratching groups of the ’90s, [The X-Men](http://www.last.fm/music/The+X-Men) (later known as [The X-Ecutioners](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+X-Ecutioners)). In 1992, he won the DMC East Coast Turn Table Championship and DJed with rapper [Akinyele](http://www.last.fm/music/Akinyele) on his cross-country tour. A mixtape favorite, after one album with the X-Ecutioners Swift released his own widely praised debut, [Soulful Fruit](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Swift/Soulful+Fruit), in 1997 on Asphodel, followed by [The Ablist](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Swift/The+Ablist) in 1999.

"Booker T. Washington “Bukka” White (November 12, 1909 – February 26, 1977) was an American [delta blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/delta%20blues) guitarist and singer.      Born between Aberdeen and Houston, Mississippi, White was a first cousin of [B.B. King](http://www.last.fm/music/B.B.+King)’s mother (White’s mother and King’s grandmother were sisters). White himself is remembered as a player of National steel guitars. He also played, but was less adept at, the piano.   “Bukka” is a phonetic spelling of Booker White’s given name, first used by his second (1937) record label (Vocalion). White started his career playing the fiddle at square dances.   He claims to have met [Charley Patton](http://www.last.fm/music/Charley+Patton) early on, although some doubt has been cast upon this; Regardless, Patton was a large influence on White. White typically played slide guitar, in an open tuning. He was one of the few, along with [Skip James](http://www.last.fm/music/Skip+James), to use a crossnote tuning in E minor, which he may have learned, as James did, from Henry Stuckey.   He first recorded for the Victor Records label in 1930 as [Washington White](http://www.last.fm/music/Washington+White). His recordings for Victor, like those of many other bluesmen, fluctuated between [country blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/country%20blues) and [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel) numbers. His gospel songs were done in the style of [Blind Willie Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Blind+Willie+Johnson), with a female singer accentuating the last phrase of each line.   Nine years later, while serving time for assault, he recorded for folklorist John Lomax. The few songs he recorded around this time became his most well- known: “Shake ‘Em on Down,” and “Po’ Boy.”      [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan) covered his song “Fixin’ to Die Blues”, which aided a “rediscovery” of White in 1963 by guitarist [John Fahey](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Fahey) and ED Denson, which propelled him onto the folk revival scene of the 1960s. White had recorded the song simply because his other songs had not particularly impressed the Victor record producer. It was a studio composition of which White had thought little until it re-emerged thirty years later.   White was at one time managed by experienced blues manager Arne Brogger. Fahey and Denson found White easily enough: Fahey wrote a letter to “Bukka White (Old Blues Singer), c/o General Delivery, Aberdeen, Mississippi.” Fahey had assumed, given White’s song, “Aberdeen, Mississippi”, that White still lived there, or nearby. The postcard was forwarded to Memphis, Tennessee, where White worked in a tank factory. Fahey and Denson soon traveled to meet White, and White and Fahey remained friends through the remainder of White’s life. He recorded a new album for Denson and Fahey’s Takoma Records, whilst Denson became his manager.   White was, later in life, also friends with fellow musician [Furry Lewis](http://www.last",20557,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'country blues', 'delta blues', 'traditional blues', 'traditional folk']",bukka white,31,"['Parchman Farm Blues', ""Fixin' to Die Blues"", ""Fixin' To Die Blues"", ""Fixin' to Die Blues"", 'Aberdeen Mississippi Blues', ""Fixin' To Die"", 'Bukka Jitterburg Swing', 'Parchman Farm Blues', 'Aberdeen Mississippi Blues', ""Fixin' To Die Blues""]"
"Culture Beat is a German Eurodance project formed in 1989 by Torsten Fenslau. The act has gone through a number of line-up changes over the years; they achieved the most success whilst fronted by singer [Tania Evans](http://www.last.fm/music/Tania+Evans) and rapper [Jay Supreme](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Supreme). Their 1993 single “Mr. Vain” was a number-one hit in 11 European countries, and the act is thought to have sold more than 10 million records worldwide. Torsten Fenslau, who initially had a desire for becoming an architect, had been working as a DJ at the Frankfurt nightclub Dorian Gray for 11 years, when he decided to form Culture Beat with his friends Jens Zimmermann and Peter Zweier.      Their first single, the ambient house track “Der Erdbeermund”, with a spoken vocal in German by Jo van Nelsen, peaked at number 11 on the German singles chart. Versions in English and French were also released (titled “Cherry Lips” and “Les lèvres cerises”, respectively). An instrumental version was also a club hit in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 55.      Shortly afterwards, Culture Beat recruited New Jersey-born rapper Jay Supreme and singer Lana Earl to front the act. While the second single “I Like You” reached number 22 in the Netherlands, their fourth single “No Deeper Meaning” managed to reach as high as number 5 in the Netherlands and number 3 on the Canadian RPM Dance Chart. They released their first album, Horizon, in 1991 which went with only minor success.      Lana was replaced by British singer Tania Evans in 1993, and the act took a harder Eurodance sound. “Mr. Vain” became their biggest hit to date, reaching number-one in 13 countries including Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom. It was also their first mainstream hit in the United States, peaking at No.17 on the Hot 100. The single was certified three times Gold in Germany for selling over 750,000 units, it also managed to reach a Gold status in several other countries including US.      Subsequent singles “Got to Get It” and “Anything” were also pan-European hits, and their second album Serenity was awarded at the ECHO award for being the Best-selling German Act Abroad, with more than two million copies sold. This also got Torsten Fenslau nominated in the same year at the Echo for being the Best Producer of the Year, who also walked away as a winner.      On November 6, 1993, Culture Beat’s founder Torsten Fenslau was killed in a car accident in Messel (district of Darmstadt) at age of 29. His brother Frank Fenslau took over the act as producer and manager.      The group returned the act in 1995 with a third album called Inside Out, preceded by a single of the same title “Inside Out” which reached number 5 in Germany and number 32 in the UK.      In 1997, Frank decided to take Culture Beat in a different musical direction diverging the act from the Eurodance sound into a more commercial pop sound. He also replaced Tania with [Kim Sanders](http://www.last",66565,world,"['bubblegum dance', 'eurodance', 'europop', 'german techno', 'hip house']",culture beat,58,"['Mr. Vain - Original Radio Edit', 'Mr. Vain', 'Mr. Vain Recall - Radio Edit', 'Got to Get It', 'Inside Out', 'Got to Get It - Original Radio Edit', 'Mr. Vain - Vain Mix', 'Mr. Vain - Mr. House', 'Anything', 'Crying in the Rain']"
"There are 2 acts by the name of Disturbed;      1) Well-known American hard rock band with lead singer David Michael Draiman, formed in 1996, with several albums including The Sickness (Giant/Reprise 2000), Believe (Giant/Reprise 2002), Ten Thousand Fists (Reprise, 2005), Indestructible (Reprise, 2008) and Asylum (Reprise, 2010).      2) Late 80’s American Thrash band who released the album Disturbing the Peace in 1988; formed by Earl Root in 86/87 and disbanded in 92/93 before his death in 2008.      1) Disturbed was formed in 1996 when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve Kmak, and Mike Wengren hired singer David Draiman in Chicago, Illinois. They have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, and released four consecutive #1 debuts a feat achieved by only two other rock bands in the history of the chart: [Metallica](http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica) and [Dave Matthews Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band). Originally classified as a nu metal band, Disturbed is now regarded by some music critics as [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) or [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal), although others now regard them as [nu metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/nu%20metal). However, the band’s genre is still being debated. When asked about die-hard metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, frontman David Draiman stated:      _”We probably have too much melody going on or we’re not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it’s not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we’re more hard rock than heavy metal these days.”_      **Early Days, The Sickness**   In their early years, Disturbed started recording several demos and played live shows. Not long after, in 2000, the band released their debut album, titled [The Sickness](http://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed/The+Sickness), which launched the band into stardom. The song [Down With the Sickness](http://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed/_/Down+With+the+Sickness) became extremely popular and was later used in many film soundtracks. Soon after the release of “The Sickness”, Disturbed released a revamped cover version of [”Stone Cold” Steve Austin](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%22Stone+Cold%22+Steve+Austin)’s theme music for WWF called “[Glass Shatters](http://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed/_/Glass+Shatters)”.

"There is more than one artist by the name ‘Jimmie Rodgers’.      1) Jimmie Rodgers (James Charles Rodgers, September 8, 1897 – May 26, 1933) was an American country singer in the early 20th century, known most widely for his rhythmic yodeling. Among the first country music superstars and pioneers, Rodgers was also known as “The Singing Brakeman”, “The Blue Yodeler”, and “The Father of Country Music”. The Bristol sessions are considered the “Big Bang” of modern country music. They were held in 1927 in Bristol, Tennessee by Victor Talking Machine Company company producer Ralph Peer. They marked the commercial debut of Jimmie Rodgers.      Rodgers’ traditional birthplace is usually given as Meridian, Mississippi; however, in documents signed by Rodgers later in life, his birthplace was listed as Geiger, Alabama, the home of his paternal grandparents. Historians who have researched the circumstances of that document, however, including Nolan Porterfield and Barry Mazor, continue to identify Pine Springs, Mississippi, just north of Meridian, as his genuine birthplace. Rodgers’ mother died when he was about six or seven years old, and Rodgers, the youngest of three sons, spent the next few years living with various relatives in southeast Mississippi and southwest Alabama, near Geiger. In the 1900 Census for Daleville, Lauderdale County, Mississippi, Jimmie’s mother, Eliza [Bozeman] Rodgers, was listed as already having had seven children, with four of them still living at that date. Jimmie [“James” in the Census] was next to the youngest at that time, and was probably born sixth of the total of seven children. He eventually returned home to live with his father, Aaron Rodgers, a Maintenance-of-Way foreman on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, who had settled with a new wife in Meridian.      Rodgers’ affinity for entertaining came at an early age, and the lure of the road was irresistible to him. By age 13, he had twice organized and begun traveling shows, only to be brought home by his father. His father found Rodgers his first job working on the railroad as a water boy. Here he was further taught to pick and strum by rail workers and hobos. As a water boy, he would have been exposed to the work chants of the African American railroad workers known as gandy dancers. A few years later, he became a brakeman on the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad, a position formerly secured by his oldest brother, Walter, a conductor on the line running between Meridian and New Orleans.   In 1924 at age 27, Rodgers contracted tuberculosis. The disease temporarily ended his railroad career, but at the same time gave him the chance to get back to the entertainment industry. He organized a traveling road show and performed across the Southeastern United States until, once again, he was forced home after a cyclone destroyed his tent. He returned to railroad work as a brakeman in Miami, Florida, but eventually his illness cost him his job",1394,country,['brill building pop'],jimmie rodgers,34,"['Kisses Sweeter Than Wine', ""Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standin' on the Corner)"", 'Honeycomb - Single Version', 'In the Jailhouse Now', 'Are You Really Mine', 'Blue Yodel (T for Texas)', 'Honeycomb - Single Version', ""Jimmie Rodgers' Dream"", 'Waiting for a Train', 'Secretly']"

Rahzel has expanded the art of beatboxing in a unique way, creating vocal beats while singing lyrics simultaneously, as is best displayed by his famous a cappella performance of “If Your Mother Only Knew” (an interpretation of Aaliyah’s song “If Your Girl Only Knew”) of which an MP3 is in wide circulation.      Rahzel has been performing live with musician and vocalist Mike Patton (Faith No More, Fantômas, etc.) as “Patton & Rahzel”.      Rahzel released his album Make The Music 2000 in 1999 on the MCA record label, followed by the 2004 release of the album Rahzel’s Greatest Knockouts for Sureshot Recordings on which he collaborates with many other artists.      In 2004, Rahzel collaborated with Björk and other beatboxers for her album Medúlla. His beatboxing skills are also featured on The Crystal Method’s album Legion of Boom, in which he provides the vocals for the song “The American Way” and others on the album.

"In the mid eighties, at the age of seventeen, Bukem discovered the joys of clubbing. The teenager regularly checked out the local [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul) clubs and legendary [rare groove](http://www.last.fm/tag/rare%20groove) all dayers. During this time he also ran a [jazz funk](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20funk) band. DJing however, was his main thing and by 1987 he gained something of a reputation for his sets. In 1990, LTJ Bukem got his first big break - at ‘Raindance’. Booked to play in front of a crowd of 10,000…      Bukem then ventured into the studio to record a track which was to become one of the most influential records of the era. This 12” titled ‘Logical Progression’ surfaced on the newly formed Vinyl Mania imprint. At once anthemic and relaxing it offered the first true blueprint to Bukem’s sonic vision. By the time of his follow up to ‘Logical Progression’ Bukem had set up his own imprint, ‘[Good Looking Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Good+Looking+Records)’ and its debut offering came in the shape of ‘Demon’s Theme’. Bukem’s next release was ‘Apollo’ in ‘92, however his biggest breakthrough came with his next release ‘Music’ in 1993. In 1994 Bukem unleashed ‘19.5’ and the similarly epic ‘Horizons’. There were remixes, which included reworks of [Jodeci](http://www.last.fm/music/Jodeci)’s ‘Feenin’ and [Michelle Gayle](http://www.last.fm/music/Michelle+Gayle)’s ‘Sweetness’ and a collaboration with David Arnold on the infamous James Bond theme to ‘Thunderball’      The start of the 21st century saw the release of his long awaited solo album ‘Journey Inwards’; a diverse and multi directional album of drum ‘n’ bass, [soul](http://www.last.fm/tag/soul), [downbeat](http://www.last.fm/tag/downbeat) and [house](http://www.last.fm/tag/house) tracks. He has also added to his impressive remixing portfolio with his interpretation of ‘The Essence’ by jazz legend [Herbie Hancock](http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock).      On top of this he has continued the ‘Progression Sessions’ series of live mixes captured on CD, featuring storming performances recorded live in London, the US, Tokyo, and Germany. Bukem also compiled the highly acclaimed ‘Soulfood’ and ‘Soul Addiction’ compilations and released not one but two ‘Producer’ series CDs.      Fast-forward to 2007 Bukem and his label re-entered the fray with new quality releases including the much anticipated Double A sided 12” featuring ‘Switch’ by LTJ Bukem and the mighty ‘Drum Toolz’ by [MC Conrad](http://www.last.fm/music/MC+Conrad) and Furney on the flip – Released November ‘07 on Good Looking.

"Lynn Rene Anderson (born September 26, 1947 in Grand Forks, North Dakota) is an American country musician, best known for her Grammy-winning 1970 country and pop hit “(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden”. She was one of the most successful female recording artists of the 1970s.      She grew up in Sacramento, California with her mother, acclaimed singer- songwriter Liz Anderson who wrote “The Fugitive” and “(All My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers”, both Merle Haggard hits, among others. She began her solo career in 1966 with “In Person”, followed by a hit with her mother’s “If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away)”.      In 1968 she married Glenn Sutton, a future Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, with whom she had a daughter, Lisa. (They divorced in 1977.)      Consistent hits followed, and she was a regular on The Lawrence Welk Show during the 1967-68 season. In 1969 Anderson signed to Columbia where her work veered a bit more toward a polished, pop sound. She released her signature song, “Rose Garden” in late 1970. The song, written by Joe South, won a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance reached number 1 on the U.S. country charts, and also hit number 3 on the pop charts, as well as being a hit in fifteen countries. Anderson also received Grammy nominations for her recordings “Big Girls Don’t Cry” (1968), “That’s a No No” (1969), and “How Can I Unlove You” (1971)> Anderson’s other hits during this period included “You’re My Man”, “Listen to a Country Song”, “Top of the World” (a number 1 country record for Anderson before becoming a pop hit for The Carpenters), “Cry”, “Keep Me in Mind”, “What a Man My Man Is” and “Smile For Me”. In 1971, she was voted Top Female Vocalist of the year by both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association. Anderson charted eight no.one singles, 18 Top-Tens and earned a total of 17 international Gold records. She was perhaps the most in-demand country female vocalist on network television throughout the 1970’s but after 1975 her records usually peaked in the top 20 as opposed to her earlier top ten success.      Anderson married a Louisiana businessman in 1978. The second marriage produced two more children, and she was divorced in 1982.      Anderson remained one of the top female country singers into the 1980’s. Her last top ten record was 1984s “You’re Welcome to Tonight”. During the late 1980’s and early 1990s, she received much press for her disputes with her now- divorced second husband. After spending time on her ranch, raising horses and participating in equestrian events, she began recording again in 1992.      “The Blugrass Sessions”, released in 2004, earned Anderson her first Grammy nomination in over 30 years.      That same year Anderson was arrested in Denton, Texas, for drunk driving.

"Weldon Leo “Jack” Teagarden (August 20, 1905 – January 15, 1964), known as “Big T” and “The Swingin’ Gate”, was a jazz trombonist, bandleader, composer, and vocalist, regarded as the “Father of Jazz Trombone”.      Born in Vernon, Texas, his brothers Charlie and Clois “Cub” and his sister Norma also became noted professional musicians. Teagarden’s father was an amateur brass band trumpeter and started young Jack on baritone horn; by age seven he had switched to trombone. He first heard jazz music played by the Louisiana Five and decided to play in the new style.      Teagarden’s trombone style was largely self-taught, and he developed many unusual alternative positions and novel special effects on the instrument. He is usually considered the most innovative jazz trombone stylist of the pre- bebop era, and did much to expand the role of the instrument beyond the old tailgate style role of the early New Orleans brass bands. Chief among his contributions to the language of jazz trombonists was his ability to interject the blues or merely a “blue feeling” into virtually any piece of music.   By 1920 Teagarden was playing professionally in San Antonio, including with the band of pianist Peck Kelley. In the mid 1920s he started traveling widely around the United States in a quick succession of different bands. In 1927, he went to New York City where he worked with several bands. By 1928 he played for the Ben Pollack band.   Within a year of the commencement of his recording career, he became a regular vocalist, first doing blues material (“Beale Street Blues”, for example), and later doing popular songs. He is often mentioned as one of the best white male jazz vocalists of the era; his singing style is quite like his trombone playing, in terms of improvisation (in the same way that Louis Armstrong sang quite like he played trumpet). His singing is best remembered for duets with Louis Armstrong and Johnny Mercer.   In the late 1920s he recorded with such notable bandleaders and sidemen as Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Bix Beiderbecke, Red Nichols, Jimmy McPartland, Mezz Mezzrow, Glenn Miller, and Eddie Condon. Glenn Miller and Teagarden collaborated to provide lyrics and a verse to Spencer Williams’ Basin Street Blues, which in that amended form became one of the numbers that Teagarden played until the end of his days.   In the early 1930s Teagarden was based in Chicago, for some time playing with the band of Wingy Manone. He played at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago. Teagarden sought financial security during the Great Depression and signed an exclusive contract to play for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra from 1933 through 1938. The contract with Whiteman’s band provided him with financial security but prevented him from playing an active part in the musical advances of the mid-thirties swing era.   Teagarden then started leading his own big band. Glenn Miller wrote the song “I Swung the Election” for him and his band in 1939",9285,blues,"['big band', 'jazz trombone', 'ragtime', 'stride', 'swing', 'tin pan alley', 'vintage jazz']",jack teagarden,34,"['Meet Me Where They Play the Blues - 2014 Remastered Version', ""I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan"", 'Misery and the Blues', 'Moonglow', ""Mis'ry and the Blues - 2014 Remastered Version"", 'Cottage For Sale', 'On The Road To Mandalay', 'Afternoon In August', ""I Don't Want To Miss Mississippi"", 'Original Dixieland One Step']"
"A fixture on the UK jungle scene since the early nineties, Photek a.k.a. Rupert Parkes is best known for his role in developing the “intelligent” drum & bass genre. Over the course of his career as Photek, Parkes has developed a sound that is simultaneously individual, innovative and accessible, earning him much respect and popularity amongst critics and music fans alike. The strength of the sound finds foundation in Photek’s incredibly detailed drum programming, which is then augmented by his sophisticated sense for combining abstract sounds with jazz and classic techno influences.      Recently Parkes has been more and more active in producing music for film, having worked on a number of scoring projects for upcoming features from his new home base in Los Angeles (most notably for The Animatrix and The Italian Job).

"Virginia Patterson Hensley (born September 8, 1932 in Winchester, Virginia; died March 5, 1963 in Camden, Tennessee), better known as Patsy Cline, was a Grammy award winning American country music singer who, despite her short life, is known as one of the most influential and acclaimed female singers in the history of popular music. Cline was best known for her rich tone and emotionally expressive bold contralto voice, which along with her role as a mover and shaker in the country music industry, has been cited as an inspiration by many vocalists of various music genres. Her hits included Walkin’ After Midnight, I Fall to Pieces, She’s Got You, Crazy and Sweet Dreams. Posthumously, millions of her albums have sold over the past 50 years. She has been given numerous awards, which have given her an iconic status with some fans similar to that of legends Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley. Ten years after her death, she became the first female solo artist inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame.      Cline was the last name of her first husband, Gerald Cline, a construction industry mogul, whom she married in 1953 and divorced in 1957. That same year, Cline married Charles Allen Dick, who worked as a linotype operator for the Winchester Star. They had a daughter, Julia Dick (b. 1958), and a son, Allen Randolph Dick (b. 1961).      Cline rocketed to fame after she performed her breakthrough hit “[Walkin’ After Midnight](http://www.last.fm/music/Patsy+Cline/_/Walkin%27+After+Midnight)” (1955) on the Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts, written by [Don Hecht](http://www.last.fm/music/Don+Hecht) and [Alan Block](http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Block). She became a mainstay on the country music showcase Grand Ole Opry in 1960. Though she began her career recording [rockabilly](http://www.last.fm/tag/rockabilly), it became clear that Cline’s voice was best suited for pop/country crossover tunes, especially love songs. Some signature songs are “[Crazy](http://www.last.fm/music/Patsy+Cline/_/Crazy)” (written by [Willie Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson) but forever linked to Cline), “[She’s Got You](http://www.last.fm/music/Patsy+Cline/_/She%27s+Got+You)”, “[I Fall To Pieces](http://www.last.fm/music/Patsy+Cline/_/I+Fall+To+Pieces)” and [Don Gibson](http://www.last.fm/music/Don+Gibson)’s “[Sweet Dreams](http://www.last.fm/music/Patsy+Cline/_/Sweet+Dreams)”.      On June 14, 1961, **Patsy Cline** and her brother were involved in a head-on car collision. The impact of the accident threw Patsy through the windshield, nearly killing her. Suffering from a jagged cut across her forehead that required stitches, a broken wrist, and a dislocated hip, she spent a month in the hospital. When she left the hospital, her forehead was still visibly scarred.

"Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American jazz vocalist with a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6). Often referred to as the “First Lady of Song” and the “Queen of Jazz,” she was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a “horn-like” improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.   Fitzgerald was a notable interpreter of the Great American Songbook. Over the course of her 60-year recording career, she sold 40 million copies of her 70-plus albums, won 14 Grammy Awards and received during her career many other major awards and honors.      Early life      Fitzgerald was born in Newport News, Virginia, the daughter of William Fitzgerald and Temperance “Tempie” Fitzgerald. Her parents were unmarried, and they had separated within a year of her birth. With her mother’s new partner, a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva, Ella and her mother moved to the city of Yonkers, in Westchester County, New York, as part of the first Great Migration of African Americans. Initially living in a single room, her mother and Da Silva soon found jobs and Ella’s half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born in 1923. By 1925, Fitzgerald and her family had moved to nearby School Street, then a predominantly poor Italian area. At the age of six, Fitzgerald began her formal education, and moved through a variety of schools before attending Benjamin Franklin Junior High School from 1929.      Fitzgerald had been passionate about dancing from third grade, being a fan of Earl “Snakehips” Tucker in particular, and would perform for her peers on the way to school and at lunchtime. Fitzgerald and her family were Methodists and were active in the Bethany African Methodist Episcopal Church, and she regularly attended worship services, Bible study, and Sunday school. The church would have provided Fitzgerald with her earliest experiences in formal music making, and she may have also had piano lessons during this period if her mother could afford it.      In her youth, Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer, although she loved listening to jazz recordings by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters. She idolized the lead singer Connee Boswell, later saying, “My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it…I tried so hard to sound just like her.”      In 1932, her mother died from a heart attack. Following this trauma, Fitzgerald’s grades dropped dramatically, and she frequently skipped school. Abused by her stepfather, she ran away to her aunt and, at one point, worked as a lookout at a bordello and also with a Mafia-affiliated numbers runner. When the authorities caught up with her, she was first placed in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale, Bronx. However, when the orphanage proved too crowded, she was moved to the New York Training School for Girls in Hudson, New York, a state reformatory. Eventually she escaped and for a time she was homeless",1407817,jazz,"['adult standards', 'jazz blues', 'soul', 'swing', 'vocal jazz']",ella fitzgerald,70,"['Dream A Little Dream Of Me - Single Version', 'Cheek To Cheek', ""It's Only A Paper Moon"", 'Summertime', ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"", 'Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall - Single Version', 'Bewitched, Bothered, And Bewildered', ""Let's Call The Whole Thing Off"", 'Someone To Watch Over Me', 'Undecided']"

After adding [Matt Bowen](http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Bowen), The Faint released _Media_, which established them within a small, national community of fans. While touring, Bowen left and was replaced by Jacob Thiele who helped move the next album, _Blank-Wave Arcade_, towards a more [dance](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance) and [electronica](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronica) influenced sound.

She is the most successful female rock artist of all time: **the Acid Queen** or **The Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll**. She started her storied career by joining [Ike Turner](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+Turner) to form The [Ike & Tina Turner](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner) Revue in 1960. They had a string of hits like [A Fool In Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/A+Fool+In+Love), [It’s Gonna Work Out Fine](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/It%27s+Gonna+Work+Out+Fine), a cover of [Creedence Clearwater Revival](http://www.last.fm/music/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival)’s “[Proud Mary](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/Proud+Mary), and the autobiographical [Nutbush City Limits](http://www.last.fm/music/Ike+&+Tina+Turner/_/Nutbush+City+Limits) and were widely admired by their audiences and peers.      After her divorce from Ike Turner (he had been abusing her for many years) she took on a solo career in the late 70’s. It wasn’t until 1983, with the release of a cover of [Al Green](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Green)’s “Let’s Stay Together”, that she proceeded to make one of the greatest comebacks in history of music. Her 5th solo album “Private Dancer” produced numerous hits and earned her four Grammy Awards. In 1985, she starred in “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” beside Mel Gibson and not only gained a NAACP Image Award for her performance as Aunty Entity, but also received a Grammy nomination for “We Don’t Need Another Hero”, a song from the film’s soundtrack. Next, Tina brought her story to the the public through her best-selling biography “I, Tina”, written with Kurt Loder. She followed “Private Dancer” with “Break Every Rule” and “Foreign Affair”. Each album was followed by successful world tours. Tina Turner announced that she would be retiring after the “Foreign Affair” Tour.      Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. That same year, she released her first greatest hits CD, “Simply The Best”, which went platinum. In 1993, her life story was made into a motion picture, “What’s Love Got To Do with It.” She helped promote it with remakes of old Ike and Tina numbers. She also recorded three new songs for the film’s soundtrack. Among the new songs was “I Don’t Wanna Fight” which went to #9 on the Billboard charts and was nominated for a Grammy award. She followed the album with an American tour.      Tina Turner came out of retirement to make her first original album in 1995 after the success of her song “Goldeneye” from the James Bond film of the same name.

Reed was a major player in the field of electric blues. His lazy, slack-jawed singing, piercing harmonica and hypnotic guitar patterns were one of the blues’ most easily identifiable sounds in the 1950s and 1960s, and had a significant impact on many rock and roll artists who followed, such as Elvis Presley, Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) and the Rolling Stones.      Reed was born in Dunleith, Mississippi, in 1925, learning the harmonica and guitar from Eddie Taylor, a close friend. After spending several years busking and performing in the area, Reed moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1943 before being drafted into the US Navy during World War II. In 1945, Reed was discharged and moved back to Mississippi for a brief period, marrying his girlfriend, Mary “Mama” Reed, before moving to Gary, Indiana to work at an Armour & Co. meat packing plant. Mama Reed appears as an uncredited background singer on many of his songs, notably the major hits “Baby What You Want Me to Do”, “Big Boss Man” and “Bright Lights, Big City”.   By the 1950s, Reed had established himself as a popular musician and joined the “Gary Kings” with John Brim, as well as playing on the street with Willie Joe Duncan. Reed failed to gain a recording contract with Chess Records, but signed with Vee-Jay Records through Brim’s drummer, Albert King. At Vee-Jay, Reed began playing again with Eddie Taylor and soon released “You Don’t Have to Go”, his first hit record. This was followed by a long string of hits.   Reed maintained his reputation despite his rampant alcoholism; sometimes his wife had to help him remember the lyrics to his songs while recording. In 1957, Reed developed epilepsy, though the condition was not correctly diagnosed for a long time, as Reed and doctors assumed it was delirium tremens.   In spite of his numerous hits, Reed’s personal problems prevented him from achieving the same level of fame as other popular blues artists of the time, though he had more hit songs than many others. When Vee-Jay Records closed down, Reed’s manager signed a contract with the fledgling ABC-Bluesway label, but Reed was never able to score another hit.   In 1968 he toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival.   Jimmy Reed died in Oakland, California in 1976, of respiratory failure, eight days short of his 51st birthday. He is interred in the Lincoln Cemetery in Worth, Illinois.   In 1991 Reed was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame",77529,blues,"['blues', 'blues-rock', 'chicago blues', 'electric blues', 'harmonica blues', 'rock-and-roll', 'traditional blues']",jimmy reed,42,"['Baby What You Want Me To Do', 'High And Lonesome', 'Big Boss Man', 'Shame, Shame, Shame', 'Big Boss Man', 'Bright Lights, Big City', ""I Ain't Got You"", 'Take Out Some Insurance', 'Honest I Do', 'Bright Lights, Big City']"
"There are several people by the name Robert Johnson:      (1) Robert Johnson (Robert Leroy Johnson, Hazlehurst, Mississippi, May 8, 1911 - Greenwood, Mississippi, August 16, 1938) was an American blues singer, guitarist and songwriter, among the most famous of Delta blues musicians.      His landmark recordings from 1936–1937 display a remarkable combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that have influenced generations of musicians. Johnson’s shadowy, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend.      The first songs to appear were “Terraplane Blues” and “Last Fair Deal Gone Down,” “Terraplane Blues” became a moderate regional hit, selling 5,000 copies.   Other songs Johnson recorded were “Come On In My Kitchen,” “Kind Hearted Woman Blues,” “I Believe I’ll Dust My Broom,” and “Cross Road Blues.” “Come on in My Kitchen” included the lines: “The woman I love took from my best friend/Some joker got lucky, stole her back again/You better come on in my kitchen, it’s going to be rainin’ outdoors.” In “Crossroad Blues,” another of his songs, he sang: “I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees/I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees/I asked the Lord above, have mercy, save poor Bob if you please/Uumb, standing at the crossroads I tried to flag a ride/Standing at the crossroads I tried to flag a ride/Ain’t nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by.”   “Stones In My Passway” and “Me And The Devil” are both about betrayal, a recurrent theme in country blues. “Hell Hound On My Trail” utilises another common theme: fear of the Devil. Other themes in Johnson’s music include impotence (“Dead Shrimp Blues” and “Phonograph Blues”) and infidelity (“Terraplane Blues,” “If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day” and “Love in Vain”).      The most widely known legend surrounding Robert Johnson says that he sold his soul to the Devil at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 61 and U.S. Highway 49 in Clarksdale, Mississippi in exchange for prowess in playing the guitar. Actually, the location Johnson made reference to is a short distance away from that intersection. The legend was told mainly by Son House, but finds no corroboration in any of Johnson’s work, despite titles like “Me and the Devil Blues” and “Hellhound on My Trail”. With this said, the song “Cross Road Blues” is both widely and loosely interpreted by many as a descriptive encounter of Johnson selling his soul.      The older [Tommy Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Johnson) (no relation, although it is speculated that they were cousins), by contrast, also claimed to have sold his soul to the Devil. The story goes that if one would go to the crossroads a little before midnight and begin to play the guitar, a large black man would come up to the aspiring guitarist, retune his guitar and then hand it back",350822,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'blues-rock', 'classic rock', 'delta blues', 'traditional blues']",robert johnson,51,"['Cross Road Blues', 'I Killed Robert Johnson', 'Sweet Home Chicago', 'Cross Road Blues - Take 1', 'Me and the Devil Blues', 'Come On In My Kitchen', 'Hellhound on My Trail', ""They're Red Hot - SA.2627-1"", ""I Believe I'll Dust My Broom"", ""Preachin' Blues (Up Jumped the Devil)""]"
"Audrey Faith Perry, later known as Faith Hill (born September 21, 1967 in Star, Mississippi), is a successful American country singer, known for her commercial success as well as her much-publicized marriage to country singer Tim McGraw.

"Theodore Shaw “Teddy” Wilson (born 1912-11-24 in Austin, Texas-died 1986-07-31 in New Britain, Connecticut) was a jazz pianist from the United States . His sophisticated and elegant style graced the records of many of the biggest names in jazz, including Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.      Wilson studied piano and violin at Tuskegee Institute. After working in the Speed Webb and Louis Armstrong bands, he joined Benny Carter’s Chocolate Dandies in 1933. In 1935 he joined the Benny Goodman Trio (which consisted of Goodman, Wilson and drummer Gene Krupa, later expanded to the Benny Goodman Quartet with the addition of Lionel Hampton). The trio performed during the big band’s intermissions. By joining the Trio, Wilson became the first black musician to perform in public with a previously all-white jazz group.      In the 1930s and 1940s he recorded fifty hit records with various singers such as Lena Horne and Helen Ward, including many of Billie Holiday’s most successful records. During these years he also recorded many highly regarded sessions with a wide range of important swing musicians, such as Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, Charlie Shavers, Red Norvo, Buck Clayton and Ben Webster.      Wilson formed his own short-lived big band in 1939, then led a sextet at Cafe Society from 1940 to 1944. In the 1950s he taught at the Juilliard School. Wilson performed as a soloist and with pick-up groups up until the final years of his life.

"**Nat “King” Cole** (March 17th 1919–February 15th 1965) was a popular American singer and [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) musician.       As a piano player, he formed a jazz trio in 1938 that played Los Angeles nightclubs, one of the first jazz trios featuring guitar and piano. Prior to this he had played music since he was a child and had worked with bands since he was sixteen. He was raised in Chicago and exposed to the abundant jazz scene there. He was heavily influenced by pianist [Earl “Fatha” Hines](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Earl+%22Fatha%22+Hines).      Later he became more popularly known as a singer and crooner and his work became more orchestrated.      His first mainstream vocal hit was in 1944 with [Straighten Up and Fly Right](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Straighten+Up+and+Fly+Right), based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Although hardly a rocker, the song’s success proved that an audience for folk- based material existed. It is considered a predecessor to the first rock and roll records. Indeed, [Bo Diddley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bo+Diddley), who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence.      Beginning in the late 1940s, Cole began recording and performing more pop- oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period with such hits as [The Christmas Song](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/The+Christmas+Song) (1946), [Nature Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Nature+Boy) (1948), [Mona Lisa](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Mona+Lisa) (1950), and his signature tune [Unforgettable](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Unforgettable) (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his musical roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, [After Midnight](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/After+Midnight). In 1991, Mosaic Records released the _Complete Nat King Cole Trio Recordings on Capitol_, which contained 349 songs on twenty-seven LPs or eighteen CDs.      Throughout the 1950s Cole continued to rack up hit after hit, including [Smile](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Smile), [Pretend](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Pretend), [A Blossom Fell](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/A+Blossom+Fell), and [If I May](http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/If+I+May). Most of his pop hits were collaborations with famed arranger/conductor [Nelson Riddle](http://www.last.fm/music/Nelson+Riddle). It was with Riddle that Cole released his first ten-inch long-play album in 1953 entitled _Sings for Two in Love_.

"**Jean “Django” Reinhardt** (23 January 1910 - 16 May 1953) was a Belgian guitarist and composer credited with popularizing [gypsy jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/gypsy%20jazz), as well as conceptualizing the style together with several other Gypsy musicians. Reinhardt, the meaning of whose nickname was “I Awake” in the Romani language, severely injured two of the digits on his left hand as a youth, and changed his guitar playing style to adapt to his handicap. Together with violinist [Stéphane Grappelli](http://www.last.fm/music/St%C3%A9phane+Grappelli), he founded the [Quintette du Hot Club de France](http://www.last.fm/music/Quintette+du+Hot+Club+de+France), regarded as one of the most innovative recording groups in the history of jazz music.      Born in Liberchies, Pont-à-Celles, Belgium into a family of Manouche Gypsies, Jean Reinhardt learned to play several instruments such as the banjo, violin and guitar from an early age; he spent most of his youth in Gypsy encampments close to Paris. His family made a living from crafting furniture, but included several amateur musicians who inspired Reinhardt. Eventually, Reinhardt was given a banjo-guitar, at which point he stopped playing the violin. During this period, he was inspired by two older Gypsy musicians, Gusti Mahla and Jean Castro. Able to make a living from his music from his teen years onwards playing in bal-musette halls in Paris, Reinhardt received little formal education until his adult life; he was taught the rudiments of literacy by fellow band member Stéphane Grappelli.      At the age of eighteen, Reinhardt was injured in a fire that ravaged the caravan he shared with Florine “Bella” Mayer, his first wife. They were very poor, and to supplement their income Bella made imitation flowers out of celluloid and paper; consequently, their home was full of this highly inflammable material. Returning from a performance late one night, Django apparently knocked over a candle on his way to bed. While his family and neighbors were quick to pull him to safety, he received first- and second- degree burns over half his body. His right leg was paralyzed and the third and fourth fingers of his left hand were badly burnt. Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again and intended to amputate one of his legs. Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year with the aid of a cane.      His brother [Joseph Reinhardt](http://www.last.fm/music/Joseph+Reinhardt), an accomplished guitarist himself, bought Django a new guitar. With painful rehabilitation and practice, Reinhardt relearned his craft in a completely new way, even as his third and fourth fingers remained partially paralyzed. Hence, he played all of his guitar solos with only two fingers, and managed to use the two injured digits only for chord work. After regaining his ability to play, Reinhardt resumed his career playing Parisian cafes",235313,jazz,"['bebop', 'cool jazz', 'french jazz', 'gypsy jazz', 'jazz', 'jazz guitar', 'swing']",django reinhardt,56,"[""I'll See You in My Dreams"", 'Minor Swing', 'Brazil', 'Out Of Nowhere', 'Swing 42', 'Djangologie', 'What a difference a day makes', ""Django's Tiger"", ""Django's Tiger"", 'Nuages']"
"Cornell Iral Haynes, Jr. (born November 2, 1974 in St. Louis, Missouri), better known by his stage name Nelly, is an American rapper, singer, actor and entrepreneur signed to Universal and Derrty Records. Born to a half Tunisian father and American mother, he has been active since 1993 as a bandmate of the rap group [St. Lunatics](http://www.last.fm/music/St.+Lunatics), and became a hip-hop superstar after the success of his solo release, Country Grammar, in 2000. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200, spawned multiple chart toppers and won three Grammy awards. His second effort, 2002’s Nellyville, was equally successful and it included the hits “Dilemma” and “Hot in Herre” and was nominated for five Grammy awards, including Album of the Year. In 2004 Nelly released two albums at the same time, Sweat and Suit, and in September they briefly held the two top spots on the charts. His latest album is Brass Knuckles, released in 2008.   Nelly has been equally active as a businessman; among other ventures, in 2003 he released his own energy drink called “Pimp Juice,” and in 2004 he became a minority owner of the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats basketball team.

"The **Violent Femmes** are an [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band, formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States in 1980. The band originally consisted of [Gordon Gano](http://www.last.fm/music/Gordon+Gano) (vocals, guitar), Brian Ritchie (bass), and Victor DeLorenzo (drums), with second drummer Guy Hoffman being added into the band in 1993. The band split in early 2009, their last recording being a cover of the [Gnarls Barkley](http://www.last.fm/music/Gnarls+Barkley) song “[Crazy](http://www.last.fm/music/Violent+Femmes/_/Crazy)”, a response to Gnarls Barkley’s cover of the Femmes song “[Gone Daddy Gone](http://www.last.fm/music/Gnarls+Barkley/_/Gone+Daddy+Gone)” released the previous year. In January 2013, it was announced that the Violent Femmes would be reuniting and performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April. They performed there, the Bottlerock Napa Valley in May and Milwaukee’s Summerfest in June. The band is also on the bill for Riot Fest, which will take place in Chicago in September.   Drummer Victor DeLorenzo said that he would be open to recording new material with the Violent Femmes, but on July 15, 2013, it was announced that Dresden Dolls drummer Brian Viglione would be replacing DeLorenzo as the band’s drummer. In a statement, DeLorenzo said “It’s always hard to write a eulogy for a lost loved one. In this case, I sadly lament the loss of a dream and an ideal that was once Violent Femmes.”      Their music is an innovative combination of American [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) music and [punk rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/punk%20rock). The lyrics mix common adolescent themes like yearning for love, sex and affection with explorations of sin, death, and the hope of salvation. Their songs often express both a lyrical and musical sense of humor. Critics often attribute the Violent Femmes as laying the groundwork of dynamicism for the 90s [grunge](http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge) movement.      In its early days, the band frequently played coffee houses and street corners. They were discovered by James Honeyman-Scott (of [The Pretenders](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pretenders)) on August 23, 1981, when the band was busking on a street corner in front of the Oriental Theatre, the Milwaukee venue that The Pretenders would be playing later that night. [Chrissie Hynde](http://www.last.fm/music/Chrissie+Hynde) invited them to play a brief acoustic set after the opening act. The band signed to [Slash Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Slash+Records) and recorded their eponymous debut in July 1982.      The group quickly gained a small cult following after the release of their self-titled album that never burgeoned into widespread popularity, although a few songs from this album did get some recognition (“[Add It Up](http://www.last.fm/music/Violent+Femmes/_/Add+It+Up)”, “[Blister In The Sun](http://www.last",342974,folk,"['acoustic punk', 'alternative rock', 'dance rock', 'indie rock', 'new wave', 'pop rock', 'punk', 'rock']",violent femmes,60,"['Blister In The Sun', 'Kiss Off', 'Add It Up', 'Gone Daddy Gone', 'American Music', 'Please Do Not Go', 'Good Feeling', 'Prove My Love', 'Country Death Song', 'Not OK']"
"**Pop Will Eat Itself** (also known as **PWEI** or the **Poppies**) was a band formed in Stourbridge, United Kingdom with band members from Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country.      An early version of the band formed in 1981 under the name From Eden; members included [Clint Mansell](http://www.last.fm/music/Clint+Mansell), Adam Mole, Chris Fradgley, Malcolm Treece and Miles Hunt . Graham Crabb was recruited (Graham being the only respondant to replace the ‘piss poor’ Miles Hunt on drums). After From Eden splintered into two bands (Treece and Hunt went on to form [The Wonder Stuff](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wonder+Stuff)) Mansell, Crabb & Mole formed Wild and Wandering, recruiting Richard March on bass. They eventually became Pop Will Eat Itself in 1986, taking the name from a quote in an NME article about Pop ‘eating itself’ suggesting that popular music continues to recycle ideas.      The band honed their songwriting skills with a string of catchy two-minute pop songs released on EPs both as Wild and Wandering and Pop Will Eat Itself. With the help of DJ John Peel, these EPs saw some airplay and enjoyed some popularity among university students. After the band feared they had accomplished all they could with their sound, they found new influences in hip hop acts such as the Beastie Boys, Run DMC and Public Enemy. Graham soon dropped the drum sticks for a mic and was replaced by a drum machine called “Dr. Nightmare.” Their style continued to develop with classics such as “There Is No Love Between Us Anymore’ and the anthemic “Def Con One”. As a result, PWEI were signed to major label RCA and they achieved top 40 hits with “Can U Dig It?” and “Wise Up! Sucker” off the album This Is the Day…This Is the Hour…This Is This!      RCA’s larger studio budget allowed the band to develop its potential further, and they released 3 successful albums on that label. The first two (…This is This! and Cure for Sanity) were recorded with the aid of legendary producer Flood, known for his work with Nine Inch Nails, U2 and many other popular 90s groups. Cure for Sanity was perhaps PWEI’s most experimental album, with a more electronic sound than previous efforts. RCA, meanwhile, was more interested chart success and so wanted the band to cut the lengthy instrumentals from their songs.      On 1992’s The Looks or The Lifestyle, the band recruited a live drummer to complement their standard array of loops and pre-programmed drums and brought back some live guitars. The record was their most commercial and polished work to date, and was arguably the Poppies’ high point, featuring top 20 hits like ‘Karmadrome’ and ‘Bulletproof.’ The single ‘Get the Girl! Kill the Baddies!’ registered as the band’s biggest hit in January 1993. By this point, RCA had already grown tired of PWEI’s stuborness and dropped them before the single was even released (the song went on to peak at 9 in the UK singles chart)",18830,country,"['big beat', 'britpop', 'electronic', 'industrial', 'industrial metal', 'industrial rock']",pop will eat itself,34,"['Ich Bin Ein Auslander', 'Their Law (feat.

"Sir Elton Hercules John, CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight in Pinner, Middlesex, England on 25 March 1947) is an immensely popular English singer, composer (mostly with lyricist [Bernie Taupin](http://www.last.fm/music/Bernie+Taupin)) and pianist. In a career spanning five decades, **Elton John** has sold over 250 million records and has over fifty Top 40 hits, making him one of the most successful musicians of all time. His 1997 tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, “[Candle In The Wind 1997](http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Candle+In+The+Wind+1997),” remains the world’s biggest selling and fastest selling single of all time.      In 1964, Dwight and his friends formed a band called [Bluesology](http://www.last.fm/music/Bluesology). By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&B musicians like [The Isley Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Isley+Brothers), Major Lance, Billy Stewart, [Doris Troy](http://www.last.fm/music/Doris+Troy) and Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry’s supporting band and played 16 times at The Marquee Club.      John was one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world during the 1970s, with a string of seven consecutive #1 records on the U.S. album charts, twenty-three Top 40 singles, sixty Top 10 hits, and six #1 hits. His success had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock and roll.      Key musical elements in John’s success included his melodic gifts matched with the contributions of his lyricist partner [Bernie Taupin](http://www.last.fm/music/Bernie+Taupin), his rich tenor and gospel- chorded piano, aggressive string arrangements, his flamboyant fashion sense and on-stage showmanship. As told by himself, his somewhat “flashy” outfits were due to the fact that he sits behind the piano and would otherwise vanish on stage.      John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and knighted in 1998. He has helped lead the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s.

"Big Joe Williams (Joseph Lee Williams, Crawford, Mississippi, October 16, 1903 – December 17, 1982) was an American Delta blues guitarist, singer and songwriter, notable for the distinctive sound of his nine-string guitar. Performing over four decades, he recorded such songs as “Baby Please Don’t Go”, “Crawlin’ King Snake” and “Peach Orchard Mama” for a variety of record labels, including Bluebird, Delmark, Okeh, Prestige and Vocalion. Williams was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame on October 4, 1992.      Williams as a youth began wandering across the United States busking and playing stores, bars, alleys and work camps. In the early 1920s he worked in the Rabbit Foot Minstrels revue and recorded with the [Birmingham Jug Band](http://www.last.fm/music/Birmingham+Jug+Band) in 1930 for the Okeh label.      In 1934, he was in St. Louis, where he met record producer Lester Melrose who signed him to Bluebird Records in 1935. He stayed with Bluebird for ten years, recording such blues hits as “Baby, Please Don’t Go” as [Joe Williams’ Washboard Blues Singers](http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Williams%27+Washboard+Blues+Singers) (1935) and “Crawlin’ King Snake” (1941), both songs later covered by many other performers. He also recorded with other blues singers, including Sonny Boy Williamson I, Robert Nighthawk and Peetie Wheatstraw.      Williams remained a noted blues artist in the 1950s and 1960s, with his guitar style and vocals becoming popular with folk-blues fans. He recorded for the Trumpet, Delmark, Prestige and Vocalion labels, among others. He became a regular on the concert and coffeehouse circuits, touring Europe and Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s and performing at major U.S. music festivals.      He died December 17, 1982 in Macon, Mississippi. Williams was buried in a private cemetery outside Crawford near the Lowndes County line. His headstone was primarily paid for by friends and partially funded by a collection taken up among musicians at Clifford Antone’s nightclub in Austin, Texas, organized by California music writer Dan Forte, and erected through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund on October 9, 1994. Harmonica virtuoso and one time touring companion of Williams, Charlie Musselwhite, delivered the eulogy at the unveiling. Williams’ headstone epitaph, composed by Forte, proclaims him “King of the 9 String Guitar.”      Remaining funds raised for Williams’ memorial were donated by the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund to the Delta Blues Museum in order to purchase the last nine- string guitar from Williams’ sister Mary May. The guitar purchased by the Museum is actually a 12-string guitar that Williams used in his later days. The last nine-string (a 1950s Kay cutaway converted to Williams’ nine-string specifications) is missing at this time. Williams’ previous nine-string (converted from a 1944 Gibson L-7) is in the possession of Williams’ road agent and fellow traveler, Blewett Thomas",21825,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'country blues', 'delta blues', 'traditional blues']",big joe williams,34,"[""Baby Please Don't Go"", 'Back Home Blues', ""Rollin' And Tumblin'"", ""Can't Listen No More"", 'Whistling Pines', 'Saturday Night Women', 'Big Fat Mama', ""Baby Please Don't Go"", 'Been In Crawford Too Long', ""Please Don't Go""]"

Widely recognized as a pivotal figure in early jazz, Morton is perhaps most notable as jazz’s first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential spirit and characteristics when notated. His composition “Jelly Roll Blues” was the first published jazz composition, in 1915. Morton is also notable for naming and popularizing the “Spanish tinge” (habanera rhythm and tresillo), and for writing such standards as “Wolverine Blues”, “Black Bottom Stomp”, and “I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say”, the latter a tribute to New Orleans personalities from the turn of the 19th century to 20th century.      Reputed for his arrogance and self-promotion as often as recognized in his day for his musical talents, Morton claimed to have invented jazz outright in 1902 — much to the derision of later musicians and critics. The jazz historian, musician, and composer Gunther Schuller says of Morton’s “hyperbolic assertions” that there is “no proof to the contrary” and that Morton’s “considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation”. However, the scholar Katy Martin has argued that Morton’s bragging was exaggerated by Alan Lomax in the book Mister Jelly Roll, and this portrayal has influenced public opinion and scholarship on Morton since.      Morton was born into a Creole of Color community in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of downtown New Orleans, Louisiana. A baptismal certificate issued in 1894 lists his date of birth as October 20, 1890; however Morton himself and his half-sisters claimed the September 20, 1885, date is correct. His World War I draft registration card showed September 13, 1884 but his California death certificate listed his birth as September 20, 1889. He was born to F. P. Lamothe and Louise Monette (written as Lemott and Monett on his baptismal certificate). Eulaley Haco (Eulalie Hécaud) was the godparent. Eulalie helped him to be christened with the name Ferdinand. Ferdinand’s parents were in a common-law marriage and not legally married. No birth certificate has been found to date. He took the name “Morton” by anglicizing the name of his stepfather, Mouton.

"Jeffrey Atkins (born February 29, 1976 in Queens, New York), better known by his stage name Ja Rule, is an American rapper, singer and actor signed to his own label Mpire Records. He began his career in the group [Cash Money Click](http://www.last.fm/music/Cash+Money+Click) and released his debut solo album, Venni Vetti Vecci, in 1999. He has since released 2000’s Rule 3:36, 2001’s Pain Is Love, 2002’s The Last Temptation, 2003’s Blood in My Eye and 2004’s R.U.L.E. He now plans to release his seventh studio album, Venni Vetti Vecci 2010, sometime later this year.      He is best-known for hits “Put It On Me”, “Between Me And You”, “Wonderful” and for being associated with Jay-Z as a part of The Murderers. Ja Rule has sold over 20 Million albums worldwide and has released six albums with one on the way. His best-selling albums are Pain Is Love and Rule 3:36. Ja Rule has beefed with rappers DMX, 50 Cent, The Game, Busta Rhymes, Dr. Dre, and Eminem.      Early life:      He attended Junior High School in Floral Park, New York, where he met his future wife Aisha Murray and they graduated in 1991. They attended Martin Van Buren High School together but he did not graduate. When Atkins was five years old, his sister died from respiratory problems. Growing up in a strict religious home, Atkin’s family did not celebrate birthdays and Christmas, and as a child, was not allowed to listen to rap music. When he first heard it, he decided to be a rapper. He would sneak the music into his house and played it on his CD player when his mother wasn’t around. Atkins is married to his high school sweetheart, Aisha Atkins née Murray.They have three children: Brittney (11), Jeffrey Junior (6) and Jordan (3).He and his family live in a mansion in New Jersey.      Rise to Fame:      At age 15, Atkins appeared with 0-1 and Chris Black as part of Cash Money Click. This would lead to him being signed by TVT Records in 1994. He would end up being heard by a young DJ who called himself DJ Irv, then later Irv Gotti. Gotti, was a friend of Jay-Z’s and he was also a DJ for Def Jam Recordings. During the mid 90s his main priority was meeting Ja Rule. He wanted to sign Ja to his new label Murder Inc. Records. He wanted Ja because of his distinct deep voice. After Irv was able to sign Ja along with DMX and Jay-Z to Def Jam. He began to have an idea that they all work together. They formed a group named The Murderers. They recorded many songs together. Friction tore the group apart, DMX, a rapper that sounds very similar to Ja accused him of trying to steal his style with the deep voice, by saying that before the three were signed Ja tried to make his voice sound lighter but heard him embrace the deep voice and tried to imitate it. They had planned to release an album together, but this idea was scrapped and they all made appearances on their respective albums.

"**Lena Mary Calhoun Horne** (June 30, 1917 – May 9, 2010) was an American singer, actress, civil rights activist and dancer. She was born in Brooklyn, New York. She had recorded and performed extensively, both independently, and with other jazz notables, including [Artie Shaw](http://www.last.fm/music/Artie+Shaw), [Teddy Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Wilson), [Billy Strayhorn](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Strayhorn), [Duke Ellington](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington), [Charlie Barnet](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Barnet), [Benny Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Carter), and [Billy Eckstine](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Eckstine).      In her biography she stated that on the day she was born, her father was in the midst of a card game trying to get money to pay the hospital costs. Her parents divorced while she was still a toddler. Her mother left later in order to find work as an actress and Lena was left in the care of her grandparents. When she was seven her mother returned and the two traveled around the state, which meant that Lena was enrolled in numerous schools (for a time she also attended schools in Florida, Georgia and Ohio). Later she returned to Brooklyn.      She quit school when she was 14 and got her first stage job at 16, dancing and later singing at the famed [Cotton Club](http://www.last.fm/music/Cotton+Club) in Harlem (a renowned theatre in which black performers played before white audiences, immortalized in the film - The Cotton Club (1984)). She was in good hands at the club, especially when people such as [Cab Calloway](http://www.last.fm/music/Cab+Calloway) and [Duke Ellington](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington) took her under their wings and helped her over the rough spots.      Before long her talent resulted in her playing before packed houses. If she had never made a film, her music career would have been enough to have ensured her legendary status in the entertainment industry, but films were icing on the cake. After she made an appearances on Broadway, Hollywood came calling.      At 21 years of age Lena made her first film, The Duke Is Tops (1938). It would be four more years before she appeared in another, Panama Hattie (1942), playing a singer in a nightclub. By now Lena had signed with MGM but, unfortunately for her, the pictures were shot so that her scenes could be cut out when they were shown in the South, since most theatres in the South refused to show films that portrayed blacks in anything other than subservient roles to whites, and most film studios did not want to take a chance on losing that particular source of revenue. Lena did not want to appear in those kinds of stereotyped roles (and who could blame her?).      In 1943 MGM loaned her to 20th Century-Fox to play the role of Selina Rogers in the all-black musical Stormy Weather (1943), which did extremely well at the box-office. Her rendition of the title song became a major hit on the musical charts",27641,jazz,"['adult standards', 'lounge', 'vocal jazz']",lena horne,38,"['Stormy Weather', 'Believe In Yourself', 'I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart', 'A Brand New Day', 'I want a little doggie', 'The Good Witch Glinda', 'I Got Rhythm', 'The Lady Is a Tramp', 'How Long Has This Been Going On?', 'From This Moment On (From ""Kiss Me Kate"") - Remastered 2002']"
"Mint Royale is a big beat electronic music act from Manchester, England. It was originally founded by the duo of Neil Claxton and Chris Baker; the latter left the band in 2004, but Claxton continued to produce music using the Mint Royale name. They are widely known for their remixes. Notably “Singin’ In The Rain”, which made #1 in the UK in 2008 after the song was used by dancer George Sampson on the hit show Britain’s Got Talent.      The band originally started in 1997. They first specialized in remixes, and became known after the release of their mix of “Tequila”, by [Terrorvision](http://www.last.fm/music/Terrorvision). They were championed by British dance guru Norman Cook, whose DJ sets regularly included their work. Their sound was similar to his, to the extent that some people mistakenly believed Mint Royale to be a pseudonym for Cook himself. Their first album, On the Ropes was released in late 1999, and though it was not a big sales hit, some songs from it have achieved recognition. The single “Don’t Falter”, featuring Lauren Laverne from [Kenickie](http://www.last.fm/music/Kenickie), was a minor hit in the British charts. The song “From Rusholme with Love” has been made recognisable through its extensive use in film and television series soundtracks. Notable examples include the theme tune for the film Kung Pow! Enter The Fist, as well as being present on the soundtrack of the films Vanilla Sky, Get Carter, Serendipity and the television series ALIAS and Spaced. The song “Because I’m Worth It” has also been used as the theme tune for the Jamie Theakston and Zoë Ball chat show The Priory.      The band released their second album, Dancehall Places, in 2002, and afterwards embarked on a series of live shows and a UK tour in 2003      Mint Royale returned to the studio to start writing and recording their third album in the April of 2004. The next few months were a turbulent time for Mint Royale with founding member Chris Baker parting company with the band. However, Neil and the resident vocalists returned to the studio to complete the recording of the third album (January 2005) and the result was ‘See You In The Morning’. In 2005 the group released “Waiting in the Rain” on the “Wait for You” EP - a remix of Singin’ in the Rain, which was featured in the January 2005 Volkswagen Golf GTI commercial. It reached initially #20 on the UK Singles Chart after it was released as a single (remixed and renamed as “Singing In the Rain”). This version also features on the album “See You in the Morning”.      <http://www.mint-royale.co.uk/>  ",21779,electronic,"['big beat', 'breakbeat', 'electronic']",mint royale,40,"['Show Me', 'Blue Song', ""Singin' in the Rain"", 'From Rusholme with Love', 'Little Words', 'From Rusholme with Love', ""Don't Falter"", 'Sexiest Man in Jamaica', 'Stop the Rock - Mint Royale Mix', 'Show Me']"
"Blind Boy Fuller (born Fulton Allen) was an American blues guitarist and vocalist. Fuller was born in July 10, 1907 in Wadesboro, North Carolina and died February 13, 1941 in Durham, North Carolina. He played a steel National resonator guitar.      As a boy Fuller learned to play the guitar and also learned from older singers the field hollers, country rags, and traditional songs and blues popular in poor, rural areas. It is reported that around 1926 he suffered from ulcerated eyes and became partially blind. His vision continued to deteriorate until 1928, when he was completely blind.      He started playing at informal gatherings and as he grew older, the opportunities for a blind black man being limited, he turned to getting what employment he could as a singer and entertainer at dives, street corners, house parties, and dances for pay.      He became well known enough that in 1935 he received an offer to record. Over a period of five years, Fuller made over 120 sides and his recordings appeared on several labels.      His style of singing was rough and direct, and his lyrics explicit and uninhibited as he drew from from every aspect of his experience as an underpriviledged person on the streets — pawnshops, jailhouses, sickness, death — with an honesty that lacked sentimentality. Although he was not sophisticated, his artistry as a folk singer lay in the honesty and integrity of his self-expression. His songs contained desire, love, jealousy, disappointment, menace and humor.[1]      Blind Boy Fuller was one of the most popular of the Piedmont blues artists that counted Reverend Gary Davis, Blind Willie McTell and Blind Blake amongst its number. He was so popular that when he died, his protégé Brownie McGhee reluctantly began a short lived career as Blind Boy Fuller No. 2 so that Columbia Records could cash in on his popularity. His song, ‘Trucking My Blues Away’, also gave America the famous saying ‘Keep On Trucking’. He was often accompanied on harmonica by Sonny Terry.      Blind Boy Fuller died from a severe bladder infection in 1942, when he was only 33 years old. Blind Boy Fuller was an expressive vocalist and a masterful guitar player, best remembered for his uptempo ragtime hits “Rag Mama Rag,” “Trucking My Blues Away,” and “Step It Up and Go.” At the same time he was capable of deeper material, and his versions of “Lost Lover Blues”, “Rattlesnakin’ Daddy” and “Mamie” are as deep as most Delta blues. Because of his popularity, he may have been overexposed on records, yet most of his songs remained close to tradition and much of his repertoire and style is kept alive by North Carolina and Virginia artists today.      The location of the final resting place of Blind Boy Fuller is Grove Hill Cemetery, located on private property in Durham, North Carolina. State records indicate that this was once an official cemetery, and Fuller’s interment is recorded. The only remaining headstone is that of Mary Caston Langey",15074,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'country blues', 'piedmont blues', 'traditional blues', 'traditional folk']",blind boy fuller,33,"[""Truckin' My Blues Away"", ""What's That Smells Like Fish"", 'Baby You Gotta Change Your Mind', 'I Crave My Pig Meat', 'Trucking My Blues Away No. 2 (Take 1)', 'Step It Up And Go', 'Rag, Mama, Rag', ""If You Don't Give Me What I Want"", 'I Want Some Of Your Pie', ""I'm a Rattlesnakin' Daddy""]"
"B.J. Thomas (born Billy Joe Thomas) straddled the line between pop/rock and country, achieving success in both genres in the late ’60s and ’70s. At the beginning of his career, he leaned more heavily on rock & roll, but by the mid-’70s, he had turned to country music, becoming one of the most successful country-pop stars of the decade.      Thomas began singing while he was a child, performing in church. In his teens, he joined the Houston-based band the Triumphs, who released a number of independent singles that failed to gain any attention. For the group’s last single, Thomas and fellow Triumph member Mark Charron wrote “Billy and Sue,” which was another flop. After “Billy and Sue,” Thomas began a solo career, recording a version of Hank Williams’ standard “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” with producer Huey P. Meaux. Released by Scepter Records in early 1966, the single became an immediate hit, catapulting to number eight on the pop charts. Although he had a series of moderate follow-up hits, including a re-release of “Billy and Sue,” Thomas failed to reenter the Top Ten until 1968, when “Hooked on a Feeling” became a number-five, gold single. The following year, he scored his biggest hit with Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head,” taken from the hit film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It was followed by a string of soft rock hits in the next two years, including “Everybody’s Out of Town,” “I Just Can’t Help Believing,” “No Love at All,” and “Rock and Roll Lullaby,” which featured guitarist Duane Eddy and the vocal group the Blossoms.      After “Rock and Roll Lullaby,” Scepter Records went out of business and B.J. Thomas headed to Paramount Records. At Paramount, Thomas had no hits, prompting the singer to pursue a new country-pop direction at ABC Records. “(Hey Won’t You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song,” his first single for ABC, became his second number-one record on the pop charts, as well as establishing a country career for the vocalist. For the next decade, he continued to have hits on the country charts, with a couple of songs — most notably “Don’t Worry Baby” — crossing over into the pop charts. During this period, he switched record companies at a rapid pace, but it did nothing to slow the pace of his hits. Thomas hit his country peak in 1983 and 1984, when he had the number-one hits “Whatever Happened to Old Fashioned Love” and “New Looks From an Old Lover,” as well as the Top Ten hits “The Whole World’s in Love When You’re Lonely” and “Two Car Garage.” Throughout the ’80s, B.J. Thomas recorded a number of hit gospel records for Myrrh concurrently with his country hits.      At the end of the ’80s, the hits began to dry up for Thomas, but he continued to tour, and put out the occasional country and gospel record in the ’90s.

"**Orbital** are an [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music duo consisting of brothers [Phil Hartnoll](http://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Hartnoll) and [Paul Hartnoll](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Hartnoll) formed in Sevenoaks, Kent, England whose career originally lasted from 1989 until 2004.      Orbital reformed in 2009 with the original lineup of Phil Hartnoll and Paul Hartnoll. In 2014 they split up again.      Orbital took their name from Greater London’s orbital motorway, the M25, which was central to the early rave scene and party network in the South East during the early days of acid house. One of the biggest names in British electronica during the 1990s, Orbital were both critically and commercially successful, being particularly known for an element of live improvisation during their shows, a rarity with techno acts. They were initially influenced by early electro and punk rock.      In 1989, Orbital recorded a track called “[Chime](http://www.last.fm/music/Orbital/_/Chime)” on their father’s cassette deck. It was released on Oh Zone Records in December 1989, and re-released on [FFRR](http://www.last.fm/label/FFRR) a few months later. The track became a rave anthem, reaching number 17 in the UK charts, and earning them an appearance on Top of the Pops, during which they wore anti-Poll Tax t-shirts. A few singles and EPs followed, and their first self-titled album, a collection of tracks recorded at various times, was released in late 1991.      In late 1992, the “[Radiccio](http://www.last.fm/music/Orbital/Radiccio)” EP barely reached the UK top 40, but it included probably their most well-known song, “[Halcyon](http://www.last.fm/music/Orbital/_/Halcyon)”. The song featured a backwards sample of [Kirsty Hawkshaw](http://www.last.fm/music/Kirsty+Hawkshaw) from [Opus III](http://www.last.fm/music/Opus+III)’s “[It’s a Fine Day](http://www.last.fm/music/Opus+III/_/It%27s+a+Fine+Day)”, and B-side “[The Naked and the Dead](http://www.last.fm/music/Orbital/_/The+Naked+and+the+Dead)” was similarly based on a line from [Scott Walker](http://www.last.fm/music/Scott+Walker)’s rendition of [Jacques Brel](http://www.last.fm/music/Jacques+Brel)’s song “[Next](http://www.last.fm/music/Jacques+Brel/_/Next)”. Halcyon was dedicated to the Hartnolls’ mother, who was addicted to the tranquiliser Halcion for many years.      The duo’s popularity grew rapidly with the release of their second album, titled “[Orbital 2](http://www.last.fm/music/Orbital/Orbital+2)” in 1993. The album featured complex arrangements and textures, and opens with the two minute track “[Time Becomes](http://www.last.fm/music/Orbital/_/Time+Becomes)”, which comprises nothing more than 2 slightly detuned, looped samples of a Michael Dorn line from Star Trek: The Next Generation, “…where time becomes a loop” being played simultaneously through the left and right channels, respectively (until 1 cycle of phase difference has happened)",174008,rock,"['alternative dance', 'big beat', 'breakbeat', 'drum and bass', 'electronic', 'hardcore techno', 'intelligent dance music', 'new rave', 'trip hop']",orbital,53,"['Halcyon and On and On', 'Tiny Foldable Cities - Edit', 'The Box - Part 2', 'The Box, Pt. 1', 'Belfast', 'Orbital', 'Orbital', 'Dancing in Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop)', 'Maru - Orbital Remix', 'Illuminate']"
"Cabell “Cab” Calloway III (December 25, 1907 – November 18, 1994) was a jazz singer, bandleader, composer and actor. He was strongly associated with the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York City, where he was a regular performer.   Calloway was a master of energetic scat singing and led one of the United States’ most popular big bands, [Cab Calloway and His Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/Cab+Calloway+and+His+Orchestra), from the start of the 1930s through to the late 1940s. Calloway’s band featured performers including trumpeters [Dizzy Gillespie](http://www.last.fm/music/Dizzy+Gillespie) and [Doc Cheatham](http://www.last.fm/music/Doc+Cheatham), saxophonists [Ben Webster](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Webster) and [Chu Berry](http://www.last.fm/music/Chu+Berry), New Orleans guitar ace [Danny Barker](http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Barker) and bassist [Milt Hinton](http://www.last.fm/music/Milt+Hinton). Calloway continued to perform until his death in 1994 at the age of 86.      Calloway was born to a middle-class family in Rochester, New York, and lived there until 1918. He later lived in Baltimore, Maryland. His father, Cabell Calloway II, was a lawyer, and his mother, Martha Eulalia Reed, was a teacher and church organist. His parents recognised their son’s musical talent, and he began private voice lessons in 1922. He continued to study music and voice throughout his formal schooling. Despite his parents’ and vocal teachers’ disapproval of jazz, Calloway began frequenting and eventually performing in many of Baltimore’s jazz clubs, where he was mentored by drummer [Chick Webb](http://www.last.fm/music/Chick+Webb) and pianist [Johnny Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Jones).      After graduating from high school, Calloway joined his older sister, Blanche, in a touring production of the popular black musical revue _Plantation Days_ (Blanche Calloway herself went on to become an accomplished bandleader before her brother did, and he often credited his inspiration to enter show business to her). Calloway attended Lincoln University, Pennsylvania , and left in 1930 without graduating.      When the tour ended in Chicago in the autumn, Cab decided to remain in Chicago with his sister, who had an established career as a jazz singer in that city. His parents had hopes of their son becoming a lawyer like his father, so Calloway enrolled in Crane College. His main interest, however, was in singing and entertaining, and he spent most of his nights at the Dreamland Cafe, the Sunset Cafe, and the Club Berlin, performing as a drummer, singer, and emcee. At the Sunset Cafe he met and performed with _Louis Armstrong_ who taught him to sing in the scat style.      The Cotton Club was the premier jazz venue in the country, and Cab Calloway and his Orchestra (he had taken over a brilliant but failing band called “The Missourians” in 1930) were hired as a replacement for the [Duke Ellington](http://www.last",70296,country,"['big band', 'jazz blues', 'swing']",cab calloway,45,"['Minnie the Moocher (Theme Song)', 'St. James Infirmary', 'Minnie The Moocher', 'Everybody Eats When They Come To My House', 'Reefer Man', 'Minnie the Moocher', 'Jumpin Jive', 'The Ghost Of Smokey Joe', 'Calloway Boogie', ""The Jumpin' Jive""]"

He escaped death in the February 3, 1959 plane crash that took the lives of Buddy Holly, [Ritchie Valens](http://www.last.fm/music/Ritchie+Valens), and [The Big Bopper](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Big+Bopper) when he gave up his seat to the latter. By the 1970s, he had become associated with so-called “outlaws,” an informal group of musicians who worked outside of the Nashville corporate scene. A series of duet albums with [Willie Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson) in the late 1970s culminated in the 1978 crossover hit, “[Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys](http://www.last.fm/music/Waylon+Jennings/_/Mamas+Don%27t+Let+Your+Babies+Grow+Up+To+Be+Cowboys)”. In 1979, he recorded the theme song for the hit television show _The Dukes of Hazzard_, and also served as the narrator (“The Balladeer”) for all seven seasons of the show.      He continued to be active in the recording industry, forming the group [The Highwaymen](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Highwaymen) with [Willie Nelson](http://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson), [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash), and [Kris Kristofferson](http://www.last.fm/music/Kris+Kristofferson). Jennings released his last solo studio album in 1998. In 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.      Jennings was born in Littlefield, Texas, the son of Lorene Beatrice (née Shipley) and William Alvin Jennings. When Waylon was eight, his father taught him how to play guitar, and Waylon formed his first band two years later. During his time working as a DJ, he befriended [Buddy Holly](http://www.last.fm/music/Buddy+Holly). The two were inspired by the music of the Mayfield Brothers of West Texas, Smokey Mayfield, Herbert Mayfield, and Edd Mayfield. When he was twenty-one, Jennings was tapped by Holly to play bass in Holly’s new band on a tour through the Midwest in early 1959. Holly also hired guitarist Tommy Allsup and drummer Carl “Goose” Bunch for the “Winter Dance Party” tour.      During the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, the charter airplane carrying Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. Richardson (aka “The Big Bopper”) crashed outside Clear Lake, Iowa, killing all on board. In his 1996 autobiography, Jennings admitted that in the years afterward, he felt severe guilt and responsibility for the crash",593618,country,"['country', 'country rock', 'nashville sound', 'outlaw country', 'texas country', 'traditional country']",waylon jennings,69,"[""Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys"", 'Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)', 'Fall in the Fall', 'Highwayman', 'Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way', 'Outlaw Shit (feat.

"**Robert Matthew Van Winkle** (born October 31, 1967), best known by his stage name **[Vanilla Ice](http://www.vanillaice.com/)**, is an American rapper. Born in Dallas, Texas, United States, and raised in Texas and South Florida, Van Winkle started his musical career in 1988 and released his debut album, ‘_[Hooked](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/Hooked)_’, in 1989 through [Ichiban Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Ichiban+Records). He soon signed a contract with [SBK Records](http://www.last.fm/label/SBK+Records), which released a reformatted version of that album under the title ‘_[To The Extreme](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/To+The+Extreme)_’. Van Winkle’s single “[Ice Ice Baby](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/_/Ice+Ice+Baby)” was the first [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) single to top the Billboard charts, and it has been credited with helping to diversify [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) by introducing it to a mainstream white audience.      Although Van Winkle was successful, he later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to adopt a more commercial appearance and had published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. He strongly resented having to ‘play along’ with claims that he had survived violent underground gang fights while also wearing glamorized outfits. After surviving a suicide attempt by drug overdose when his mainstream fame evaporated, Van Winkle was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. Further albums by Van Winkle, including ‘_[Hard To Swallow](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/Hard+To+Swallow)_’, ‘_[Bi- Polar](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/Bi-Polar)_’, and ‘_[Platinum Underground](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/Platinum+Underground)_’, featured a less mainstream-oriented sound inspired by [alternative metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20metal). His latest album is ‘_Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus_’ (better known as just ‘_[WTF](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/WTF)_’), which he released in 2011, which feature Ice’s return to the more [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) and classic [hip- hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) sound that was present in some of his past classics.      As stated before, Van Winkle signed a contract with SBK Records in 1990, who reissued ‘_Hooked_’ under the title ‘_[To The Extreme](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanilla+Ice/To+The+Extreme)_’. The reissue contained new artwork and music. According to Van Winkle, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance. Getting a break touring with [MC Hammer](http://www.last.fm/music/MC+Hammer), Van Winkle largely copied that artist’s large stage shows, oversize pants, flamboyant hairstyles, and more",221107,classic,"['hip house', 'miami hip hop']",vanilla ice,60,"['Ice Ice Baby', 'Ice Ice Baby', 'Ninja Rap', 'Vanilla Ice Cream', 'Vanilla Ice Cream', 'Play That Funky Music', 'Ice Ice Baby - Radio Mix', 'Ice Ice Baby', 'Ice Ice Baby', 'Vanilla Ice Cream']"
"Christopher Brian Bridges (born September 11, 1977 in Champaign, Illinois), better known by his stage name Ludacris, is a Grammy award winning American rapper, SAG award winning actor and co-founder of the label Disturbing Tha Peace. He is the highest selling Southern hip hop solo artist of all time with over 15 million units sold in the United States and around 20 million records sold worldwide. He released his debut album Incognegro in 1999 and has since released a further seven albums. His ninth studio album, Ludaversal, will be released sometime in 2012.      Early years      Bridges began his music career as a radio personality and DJ as Chris Lova Lova on Hot 97, an urban radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. He made his recorded debut on “Phat Rabbit,” a track from Timbaland’s 1998 album Tim’s Bio: Life from the Basement. Although both Timbaland and Jermaine Dupri showed interest in signing Ludacris, he decided to release the album “Incognegro” independently in 1999. The album sold over 50,000 copies through the Atlanta based independent music distributor, Southern Music Distribution. The same year, he recorded the theme to the video game Madden NFL 2000. Scarface, an original member of the Geto Boys, signed Ludacris in 2000 to Def Jam Recordings, and created a new imprint, Def Jam South, around him.      Back for the First Time      Ludacris released his major label debut, Back for the First Time, in October 2000. The album reached as high as #4 on the charts, and was a major success. Ludacris made his mark on the industry with singles such as “Southern Hospitality” and “What’s Your Fantasy”, along with his first ever single “Phat Rabbit”, from 2 years prior. Back for the First Time was the beginning of Ludacris’s explosion to the top of the rap world.      Word of Mouf      Ludacris promptly completed his next album, Word Of Mouf and released it at the end of 2001. Its lead single, “Rollout (My Business)” was boycotted in many American video stations. Despite the controversy, the video was nominated for a 2003 VMA, and Luda performed it live at the awards’ pre-show. Ludacris also toured with Papa Roach in 2002 after the release of their sophomore album lovehatetragedy. Ludacris reached a new level of notoriety when TV’s Bill O’Reilly expressed outrage that Pepsi had hired Ludacris as a spokesman. O’Reilly repeatedly attacked Ludacris’s foul language and called for a nation- wide boycott of Pepsi, who then fired Ludacris and hired Ozzy Osbourne’s family instead.      Chicken-N-Beer      During the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, “Act A Fool” from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his upcoming album, Chicken & Beer, called “P-Poppin” (short for “Pussy Poppin’”)",7124352,soundtrack,"['atl hip hop', 'dance pop', 'pop', 'pop rap', 'r&b', 'urban contemporary']",ludacris,80,"['Yeah!

"Deftones is an American [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock)/[alternative metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20metal) band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988, consisting of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Chi Cheng (bass), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Sergio Vega (formerly of _Quicksand_) took on bass duties in mid-2009 in substitution for Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013 due to cardiac arrest.      While they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result they are often coined today as an alternative rock band.      Critics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, “Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement […] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt- metal.”      Frontman Chino Moreno’s poetic lyrics—described by a Time magazine critic as “fiercely intelligent”—are often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited Morrissey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, The Cure’s Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode’s David Gahan among his favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers’ sweeping sense of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno’s vocals.      Deftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno’s [Team Sleep](http://www.last.fm/music/Team+Sleep) and drummer Abe Cunningam’s [Phallucy](http://www.last.fm/music/Phallucy).

"Etta James (1938-2012) was a U.S. blues, soul, R&B, rock & roll, and jazz singer and songwriter. She is the winner of four Grammies, seventeen Blues Music Awards, and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (in 1993), the Blues Hall of Fame (in 2001), and the Grammy Hall of Fame (in both 1999 and 2008).      James was born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles, California, on 25th January 1938, to an unmarried fourteen-year-old mother, Dorothy Hawkins. According to Etta, her mother claimed that her father was the white Rudolph “Minnesota Fats” Wanderone, and that they received financial support from him on the condition that they keep his paternity a secret. This seems unlikely, though it has not been definitively disproved. Etta was born in Los Angeles in 1938. At the time, Wanderone was known to be managing a pool hall in Washington, D.C. and had not yet become known to be the cross-country traveller he later became.      She received her first professional vocal training at five years old from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir at St Paul Baptist Church in Los Angeles. Her family moved to San Francisco in 1950, and she teamed up with two other girls to form a doo-wop singing group. When the girls were fourteen, band leader Johnny Otis had them audition. They sang an answer to Hank Ballard’s “Work with Me, Annie” called “Roll Wwth Me Henry”. Otis particularly liked the song, and against her mother’s wishes, James and the trio went to Los Angeles to record the song in 1954. The song was recorded on the label Modern Records. By this time, the trio renamed the song “The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)” and released it in 1955. James named her vocal group The Peaches. Richard Berry, a Los Angeles doo-wop luminary, is featured on some of their records.      “The Wallflower” reached number two on the rhythm and blues charts in February 1955, but was undercut in the wider market by a rushed-out cover version by Georgia Gibbs on Mercury Records; in fact, the very first time Gibbs was recorded in studio, they used the first take recorded and it became number one on the top 100 songs nationally. The song’s royalties were divided between Hank Ballard, Etta James, and Johnny Otis, and its huge success attracted the attention of the R&B world, resulting in James going on tour with Little Richard. On the tour, though, according to James, she witnessed and experienced situations to which minors are not usually privy, and she allegedly acquired a drug habit.      Soon after the success of “Wallflower”, The Peaches and James parted company, but this did not halt her career. Shecontinued to record and release albums throughout much of the decade, and enjoyed more success. Her follow-up, “Good Rockin’ Daddy”, became another fifties hit. Other songs however, such as “Tough Lover” and “W-O-M-A-N” failed to gain any significant success",888663,blues,"['adult standards', 'jazz blues', 'soul', 'soul blues', 'vocal jazz']",etta james,67,"['At Last', ""I'd Rather Go Blind"", 'A Sunday Kind Of Love', ""Something's Got A Hold On Me"", 'I Just Want To Make Love To You - Single Version', 'Stormy Weather', ""Something's Got A Hold On Me"", 'Night Time Is the Right Time', 'At Last', ""Something's Got A Hold On Me""]"
"Lowell Fulson (March 31, 1921 – March 7, 1999) was a big-voiced blues guitarist and songwriter, in the West Coast blues tradition. Fulson was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He also recorded for business reasons as Lowell Fullsom and Lowell Fulsom. After T-Bone Walker, Fulson was the most important figure in West Coast blues in the 1940s and 1950s.      According to some sources, Fulson was born on a Choctaw reservation in Oklahoma. Fulson has stated that he is of Cherokee ancestry through his father, but he has also claimed Choctaw ancestry. At the age of eighteen, Fulson moved to Ada, Oklahoma, and joined Alger “Texas” Alexander for a few months in 1940, but later moved to California, forming a band which soon included a young Ray Charles and tenor saxophone player, Stanley Turrentine. He recorded for Swing Time in the 1940s, Chess Records (Checker Records) in the 1950s, Kent Records in the 1960s, and Rounder Records (Bullseye) in the 1970s.      “Reconsider Baby” came from a long term pact inked with Chess Records in 1954. It was cut in Dallas under Stan Lewis’ supervision with a saxophone section that included David “Fathead” Newman on tenor and Leroy Cooper on baritone.      Jackie Brenston played in Fulson’s band between 1952 and 1954.      Fulson stayed with Checker into 1962, but a change of record labels worked wonders when he jumped over to the Los Angeles based, Kent Records. 1965’s driving “Black Nights” became his first hit in a decade, and “Tramp,” did even better, restoring the guitarist to R&B stardom.      Fulson was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1993 and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album. His “Reconsider Baby” was chosen by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the “500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll”.      In 1993 at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California a show entitled “California Blues - Swingtime Tribute” opened with Fulson plus Johnny Otis, Charles Brown, Jay McShann, Jimmy Witherspoon, Jimmy McCracklin and Earl Brown.      A resident of Los Angeles, Fulson died in Long Beach, California in March 1999, at the age of 77. His companion Tina Mayfield stated that the causes of death were complications from kidney disease, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. He was the father of four and grandfather of thirteen.      Fulson was interred in Inglewood Park Cemetery, in Inglewood, California.         Lowell Fulson recorded every shade of blues imaginable. Polished urban blues, rustic two-guitar duets with his younger brother Martin, funk-tinged grooves that pierced the mid-’60s charts, even an unwise cover of the Beatles’ “Why Don’t We Do It in the Road!” Clearly, the veteran guitarist, who was active for more than half a century, wasn’t afraid to experiment. Perhaps that’s why his last couple of discs for Rounder were so vital and satisfying — and why he remained an innovator for so long",12334,blues,"['blues', 'electric blues', 'jump blues', 'soul blues', 'texas blues', 'traditional blues']",lowell fulson,35,"[""Why Don't We Do It In The Road"", 'Reconsider Baby', ""Don't Leave Me Baby"", ""Why Don't We Do It In The Road?"", 'Do Me Right', 'Sleeper', 'Little By Little', 'Jukebox Shuffle', ""Blues Don't Leave Me"", 'Tramp - Live']"
"**The Everly Brothers** was an American (Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, USA) duo of singing brothers: Don and Phil, (Don Everly, born Isaac Donald Everly February 1, 1937, Brownie, Kentucky; Phil Everly, born Phillip Everly, January 19, 1939, Chicago, Illinois, died January 3, 2014, in Burbank, California). The pair of male siblings became top-selling country-influenced rock and roll performers, best known for their steel-string guitar playing and close harmony singing. Their greatest period of chart success came between 1957 and 1961. Overall, they had 35 US Billboard Top 100 singles, 26 in the top 40. They hold the record for the most US Top 100 singles by any duo. They were elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.      Don, the older brother was born in Brownie, a now-defunct coal mining town located outside of Central City, Kentucky. Phil Everly was born in Chicago. The sons of country musicians, Margaret Embry and Isaac Milford (“Ike”) Everly, Jr.,[1] the Everly Brothers grew up in Iowa. They performed with their parents on live radio and in small-market live shows in the midwest.      In addition to both being competent guitarists, the brothers used a style of close harmony singing in which each brother sang a tune that could often stand on its own as a plausible melody line. This is in contrast to classic harmony lines which, while working well alongside the melody, would sound strange if heard by themselves. One of the best examples of their close-harmony work is their recording of “Devoted to You”.      The duo’s approach to harmony singing had a strong influence on the rock and roll groups of the 1960s. For example, both The Beatles and The Beach Boys developed their early singing style by performing Everlys covers. The Beatles based the vocal arrangement of their song “Please Please Me” directly upon that of “Cathy’s Clown”.      The Everly Brothers recorded their own first single, “Keep A’ Lovin’ Me,” in 1956, under the aegis of Chet Atkins, but it flopped. However their next single, “Bye Bye Love,” (which had been rejected by 30 other acts, including Elvis Presley), became an across-the-board smash, reaching #2 on the pop charts, and #1 on both the Country, and the R & B charts. The song, written by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, became the Everly Brothers’ first million-seller.      They soon became known as the stalwarts of Archie Bleyer’s Cadence Records label. Working with the Bryants, the harmonic duo had a number of hits in the U.S. and the UK, the biggest of which were “Wake Up Little Susie,” “All I Have to Do Is Dream,” and “Bird Dog.”      In 1960, when they signed with Warner Bros. Records, they continued to have hits. Their first with WB, 1960’s “Cathy’s Clown,” launched the brothers back to the top of the charts. It was released as number WB1, the first release in the United Kingdom by Warner Brothers Records",326203,classic,"['adult standards', 'brill building pop', 'bubblegum pop', 'folk rock', 'lounge', 'mellow gold', 'rock-and-roll', 'rockabilly', 'sunshine pop']",the everly brothers,62,"['All I Have to Do Is Dream', 'Bye Bye Love', 'Wake up Little Susie', 'Crying in the Rain', 'Walk Right Back', ""('Til) I Kissed You"", ""Cathy's Clown"", ""Cathy's Clown - Remastered Album Version"", 'Let It Be Me', 'Devoted to You']"
"**Alton Glenn Miller ** was born in Clarinda, Iowa on March 1, 1904. He started his musical career when his father brought home a mandolin. As soon as possible, he traded the instrument for an old horn, which he practiced diligently.      During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Miller managed to earn a living working as a freelance trombonist in several bands. His first band was formed in 1937 but failed to distinguish itself and eventually broke up.      Following the break-up of his first band, Miller realized that he needed to develop a unique sound, and decided to make the clarinet play a melodic line with a tenor saxophone on the same note, while three other saxophones harmonized. With this sound combination, the Miller band that became the most popular was born in 1938. After a shaky start, it made his new band a nationwide hit.      In 1942, Miller joined the United States Army Air Forces where he continued his musical career with the Army Air Force Band.      On December 15, 1944, Miller was to fly from the United Kingdom to Paris, France, to play for the soldiers who had recently liberated Paris. His plane departed from RAF Twinwood Farm in Clapham, Bedfordshire and disappeared while flying over the English Channel. No trace of the aircrew, passengers or plane has ever been found. Miller’s status is missing in action.      His music is still iconic of the time period in which he lived and continues to draw thousands of fans of all age groups.      Glenn Miller was a popular visitor to Bedford and its American Air force bases.

According to [ Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=21793), Loretta Lynn’s superstar Country career started in 1960 when she recorded ” I’m a Honky Tonk Girl ” as her debut single. The song was a minor hit, climbing to #14 on Billboard’s C&W Chart. By the late 1960s she had begun picking up various Female Vocalist of the Year trophies and in 1972 the singer became the first woman in history to win the Country Music Association’s Entertainer of the Year trophy. Lynn dominated the Country charts throughout the rest of the decade and has continued to record hit records through the ensuing years.

"**Black Sabbath** is an English [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal) band that formed in 1968 in Birmingham, West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, originally comprising [Ozzy Osbourne](http://www.last.fm/music/Ozzy+Osbourne) (vocals), [Tony Iommi](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+Iommi) (guitar), [Geezer Butler](http://www.last.fm/music/Geezer+Butler) (bass), and [Bill Ward](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Ward) (drums). In the early [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s), they were the first to pair heavily distorted, sonically dissonant [blues rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock) at slow speeds with lyrics about drugs, mental pain and abominations of war, thus giving birth to generations of metal bands that followed in their wake. Their name itself taken from [a notorious horror film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_\(film\)), they are often credited with creating the [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal) genre as well as the [doom metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/doom%20metal) subgenre.      Black Sabbath was formed in Aston, a poor district of Birmingham damaged by bombing during World War II, under the name Polka Tulk Blues Band (soon shortened to “Polka Tulk”), later Earth. Initially a rockin’ [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) band, Earth moved in a darker direction when the group, especially bassist Geezer Butler, being fans of the black magic novels of Dennis Wheatley, tried to make music to have the same effect as a horror movie or novel. Ozzy Osbourne wrote the lyrics to the second song they wrote together, “[Black Sabbath](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath/_/Black+Sabbath)” (the song name was inspired by [a 1963 Mario Bava film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_\(film\))), and Tony Iommi wrote a riff based on the tritone, sometimes called “Diabolus en Musica” (“the Devil in Music”).      Later in their careers, Geezer Butler would write most of the lyrics to Black Sabbath songs, taking direct inspiration from Ozzy’s instrumental ideas. In their _Last Supper_ concert film, the band stated that the song is based on an experience Geezer had one night when he saw a black object at the end of his bed and noticed the next day that an occult book Ozzy had given him was missing. When the band found themselves being confused with another local band called Earth, which had a far lighter sound, they adopted the song title as their new name.      As the band evolved, they added more European [folk](http://www.last.fm/tag/folk) elements and gothic flourishes to their sound, which was like few groups during their time. Their lyrics dealt with darker issues than most conventional rock. Towards the late [60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s), many British bands were into the peace movement and the hippie subculture, whilst Sabbath chose to distinguish themselves by dealing with heavier issues; the occult, war, apocalypse, drugs, and [gothic](http://www.last.fm/tag/gothic) storytelling",3839502,blues,"['album rock', 'birmingham metal', 'classic rock', 'hard rock', 'metal', 'rock', 'stoner rock', 'uk doom metal']",black sabbath,74,"['Paranoid - 2016 Remaster', 'Iron Man - 2014 Remaster', ""War Pigs / Luke's Wall - 2014 Remaster"", 'Children of the Grave - 2014 Remaster', 'Heaven and Hell - 2008 Remaster', 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath - 2014 Remaster', 'N.I.B.', 'Sweet Leaf - 2014 Remaster', 'God Is Dead?', 'Planet Caravan - 2013 Remaster']"
"White Zombie was a [metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal) band from New York City, New York who were active between 1985 and 1998. In their most popular lineup, they consisted of [Rob Zombie](http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Zombie) (vocals, guitar), [Jay Yuenger](http://www.last.fm/music/Jay+Yuenger) (guitar), [Sean Yseult](http://www.last.fm/music/Sean+Yseult) (bass), and [John Tempesta](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Tempesta) (drums). They were considered part of the [industrial metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20metal), [groove metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/groove%20metal) and [alternative metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20metal) genres, although they originally began as a [noise rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/noise%20rock) band. After they disbanded, Rob Zombie would go on to a wildly successful career as a solo artist, film director and screenwriter.      Named after the 1932 Bela Lugosi film, White Zombie’s musical style was sample-heavy, based around groovy riffs and Rob Zombie’s snarling vocals. The samples that filled their records were mostly from obscure horror films, but used creatively to create a kind of carnival freak-show vibe.      Rob Zombie, still known at this time as Rob Cummings, supported himself through multiple jobs, including working as a cycle courier. Most famously, he was a production assistant on Pee-Wee’s Playhouse, but he also worked as a designer on pornographic magazines. At this time, he became involved with Shauna Reynolds, another up-and-coming designer. Together they shared a love of classic horror and sci-fi, heavy music, and the weirder corners of American underground culture. They decided to form a band that would draw upon all these influences and White Zombie was formed. Rob took vocals and the name Rob Straker (later changed to Rob Zombie), while Reynolds became the bassist and assumed the name of Sean Yseult. They became the only constants in the often- fluctuating band line-up.      [White Zombie](http://www.last.fm/music/White+Zombie) best showed their signature style on their final two studio albums. _[La Sexorcisto](http://www.last.fm/music/White+Zombie/La+Sexorcisto): Devil Music, Vol. 1_ and _[Astro-Creep: 2000](http://www.last.fm/music/White+Zombie/Astro- Creep:+2000) Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head_ were impressive displays of their sample/riff style, thanks to higher production values.      In 1998, Rob Zombie founded his own label, Zombie-A-Go-Go, signing [surf](http://www.last.fm/tag/surf) and [horror](http://www.last.fm/tag/horror) acts like [The Bomboras](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bomboras) and [The Ghastly Ones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ghastly+Ones), as well as compiling the mix album Halloween Hootenany.

"Rammstein is a German metal band which was formed in 1994, in Berlin, and consists of [Till Lindemann](http://www.last.fm/music/Till+Lindemann) (lead vocals), [Richard Kruspe](http://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Kruspe) (lead guitar and backing vocals), [Paul Landers](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Landers) (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), [Oliver Riedel](http://www.last.fm/music/Oliver+Riedel) (bass guitar, “Ollie”), [Christoph Schneider](http://www.last.fm/music/Christoph+Schneider) (drums and Electronic percussion, “Doom”) and [Christian Lorenz](http://www.last.fm/music/Christian+Lorenz) (keyboards, “Flake”). The band is widely accepted as part of the Neue Deutsche Härte scene, alongside bands such as [Oomph!](http://www.last.fm/music/Oomph!), [Laibach](http://www.last.fm/music/Laibach), and [Die Krupps](http://www.last.fm/music/Die+Krupps). Their songs are performed almost exclusively in German. They have sold over 22 million records worldwide. Rammstein’s entire catalogue is published by [Universal](http://www.last.fm/label/Universal) Music Group. Since its formation, Rammstein has had no changes in lineup.   Although the majority of their songs are written in German, Rammstein has had success across the world.      **Name**      Rammstein takes its name indirectly from the West German town of Ramstein- Miesenbach, the site of the flight show disaster on August 28, 1988. The band’s signature song, the eponymous Rammstein, is a commemoration of the tragedy that took place at the Ramstein Air Base. The extra “m” in the band’s name makes it translate literally as “ramming stone” to convey the Teutonic sound of their music. In a short period before the band became well known, they performed using the name “Rammstein-Flugschau” (literally meaning Rammstein-Airshow.)      **Formation**      Rammstein was founded by guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe. In 1989, he escaped to West Berlin and started the band, [Orgasm Death Gimmick](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgasm+Death+Gimmick). At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially that of [Kiss](http://www.last.fm/music/Kiss). After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin where Till Lindemann worked as a basket weaver and played drums in the band [First Arsch](http://www.last.fm/music/First+Arsch) (loosely translated as “Apex Ass”). At this time, Richard lived with Oliver Riedel, of the band [The Inchtabokatables](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Inchtabokatables), and Christoph “Doom” Schneider (of [Die Firma](http://www.last.fm/music/Die+Firma)). Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him. He envisioned something that would combine machines as well as the sound of hard guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he persuaded Lindemann to join Rammstein",3358027,electronic,"['alternative metal', 'german metal', 'industrial', 'industrial metal', 'industrial rock', 'neue deutsche harte', 'nu metal']",rammstein,82,"['Du hast', 'DEUTSCHLAND', 'AUSLÄNDER', 'DEUTSCHLAND', 'ZEIG DICH', 'RADIO', 'Feuer frei!', 'Sonne', 'PUPPE', 'Ich will']"
"Toby Keith Covel (born July 8, 1961 in Clinton, Oklahoma, United States) is an American country music singer and songwriter. His family moved to Moore, Oklahoma (a suburb of Oklahoma City) when Keith was young. His grandmother owned a supper club and Keith became interested in the musicians who came there to play. He got his first guitar at the age of 8. Keith attended Moore High School where he played on the football team.      Keith graduated from Moore High School and, in 1979, went to work as a derrick hand in the booming oil fields of Oklahoma. He worked his way up to become an operation manager. At the age of 20, he formed the Easy Money band and they played local bars as he continued to work in the oil industry. At times, he would have to leave in the middle of a gig if he was paged to work in the oil field.      In 1982, the oil industry in Oklahoma began a rapid decline and Keith soon found himself unemployed. He fell back on his football training and played defensive end with the semi-pro Oklahoma City Drillers while continuing to perform with his band. (The Drillers were an unofficial farm club of the USFL’s Oklahoma Outlaws; Keith tried out for the Outlaws but did not make the team.) After two years with the Drillers, Keith decided to try music full time. His family and friends were doubtful he would succeed, but in 1984, Easy Money began playing the honky tonk circuit in Oklahoma and Texas. The band cut a single titled Blue Moon and the song received some airplay on local radio stations in Oklahoma.      In 1993 , Keith went to Nashville, Tennessee. Keith hung out and busked on Music Row and at a place called Houndogs. He distributed copies of a demo tape the band had made to the many record companies in the city. There was no interest by any of the record labels and Keith returned home feeling depressed. Keith had promised himself to have a recording contract by the time he was 30 years old or give up on music as a career. He had already passed that age without any prospects for a recording contract.      Fortunately for Keith, a fan of his, who was a flight attendant, gave a copy of Keith’s demo tape to Harold Shedd, a Mercury Records executive, while he was traveling on a flight she was working. Shedd liked what he heard, went to see Keith perform live and then signed him to a recording contract with Mercury. His debut single, “Should’ve Been a Cowboy” (1993), went to number 1 on the Billboard country singles chart, and his self-titled debut album was certified platinum. Other hit singles included “A Little Less Talk And A Lot More Action” and “Wish I Didn’t Know Now.”      Keith moved briefly to Polydor Records and released his next two albums Boomtown (1994) and Blue Moon (1996). The albums went gold and platinum respectively. In 1996, Keith was also featured on the Beach Boys’ now out-of- print 1996 album “Stars and Stripes Vol",1119702,country,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road']",toby keith,71,"[""Should've Been A Cowboy"", 'Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue (The Angry American)', 'As Good As I Once Was', 'Red Solo Cup', 'Beer For My Horses', 'Made in America', 'I Love This Bar', 'American Soldier', 'American Ride', 'I Wanna Talk About Me']"
"**Cypress Hill** is an American [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop) group from South Gate, California. Cypress Hill was the first latino group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums and one of the first rap groups to gain a following with fans of [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) and [metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/metal). The band was originally called DVX, but the name was changed after Mellow Man Ace left in 1988.      Their first album, which was self-titled, was released in August 1991. Its single was “[Phuncky Feel One](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Cypress+Hill/_/Phuncky+Feel+One)”, but it was the B-side “[How I Could Just Kill a Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill/_/How+I+Could+Just+Kill+a+Man)” (formerly “Trigga Happy Nigga”) that attracted more airplay on urban radio and college radio. Based on the success of the single and other tracks such as bilingual track “[Latin Lingo](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill/_/Latin+Lingo)” and X-rated Spanish track “[Tres Equis](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill/_/Tres+Equis)”, the album sold two million copies in the US alone. Subsequently, DJ Muggs produced the first [House of Pain](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain) album, then worked on other projects like [Funkdoobiest](http://www.last.fm/music/Funkdoobiest). The band made their first appearance at Lollapalooza on the side stage in 1992.      Black Sunday, the group’s second album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1993, recording the highest Soundscan for a rap group up until that time. Also with their debut still on the charts they became the first rap artists to have 2 albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 at the same time. With “Insane in the Brain” becoming a crossover hit, the album went triple platinum in the U.S. and sold about 3.25 million copies.      Cypress Hill was banned from Saturday Night Live after Muggs smoked cannabis on-air and the band trashed their instruments while playing their second single “I Ain’t Goin’ Out Like That”. The band headlined the “Soul Assassins” tour with House of Pain and Funkdoobiest as support, then performed on a college tour with Rage Against the Machine and Seven Year Bitch. In 1993, Cypress Hill also had two tracks on the Judgment Night soundtrack, teamed up with Pearl Jam and Sonic Youth.      The band played at the 1994 Woodstock Festival introducing their new member Eric Bobo, formerly a percussionist with the Beastie Boys. Bobo is the son of salsa musician Willie Bobo. Rolling Stone magazine named the band as the best rap group in their music awards voted by critics and readers. Cypress Hill played at Lollapalooza for two successive years, topping the bill in 1995. They appeared on the The Simpsons episode “Homerpalooza”.      Their third album Cypress Hill III: Temples of Boom was released in 1995 selling 1.5 million copies and reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the hit single “Throw Your Set in the Air”",1023171,soundtrack,"['chicano rap', 'gangster rap', 'hardcore hip hop', 'hip hop', 'rap', 'rap rock', 'west coast rap']",cypress hill,70,"['Insane in the Brain', 'How I Could Just Kill a Man', 'Hits from the Bong', '(Rock) Superstar', 'Hits from the Bong', 'I Wanna Get High', 'Tequila Sunrise (feat.

"Lynyrd Skynyrd (pronounced /ˌlɛnərd ˈskɪnərd/ LEN-ərd-SKIN-ərd) is a Southern Rock band, formed in Jacksonville, Florida, USA in 1964. The band became prominent in the Southern United States in 1973, and rose to worldwide recognition before three members and one road crew member died in an airplane crash in 1977. The band reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant’s younger brother Johnny as the frontman. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record. Of its original members, only Gary Rossington remains with the band as of 2010. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.      History   Early years      In the summer of 1964, teenage friends Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, and Gary Rossington, formed the band “The Noble Five”, which then changed in 1965 to “My Backyard”, when Larry Junstrom and Bob Burns joined in Jacksonville, Florida. Their early influences included British Invasion bands such as Free, The Yardbirds, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles, as well as Southern blues and country & western music. In 1968, the group won a local Battle of the Bands contest and the opening slot on several Southeast shows for the California-based psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock.      In 1970, Van Zant sought a new name. “One Percent” and “The Noble Five” were each considered before the group settled on Leonard Skinnerd, a mocking tribute to a physical-education teacher at Robert E. Lee High School, Leonard Skinner, who was notorious for strictly enforcing the school’s policy against boys having long hair. The more distinctive spelling was adopted before they released their first album. Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum.      In 1970, the band auditioned for Alan Walden, who would later become their manager on the newly formed Hustler’s Inc. Walden worked with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Pete Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving, blues-rock sound and image, and experimenting with making studio recordings.      During this time, they went through a number of member changes, with Van Zant, Collins and Rossington remaining the only constants. Burns and Junstrom left the band, and were briefly replaced by Rickey Medlocke on drums and Greg Walker on bass. In 1971, with this lineup, they made some recordings at the famous Muscle Shoals studio. By the time they made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns had rejoined the band and Leon Wilkeson had become Larry Junstrom’s permanent replacement on bass, with Medlocke and Walker having left to play with the southern rock band Blackfoot",2265868,blues,"['album rock', 'blues-rock', 'classic rock', 'country rock', 'hard rock', 'mellow gold', 'rock', 'southern rock']",lynyrd skynyrd,75,"['Sweet Home Alabama', 'Free Bird', 'Simple Man', 'Gimme Three Steps', ""Tuesday's Gone"", 'The Ballad Of Curtis Loew', 'Call Me The Breeze', 'That Smell', 'Saturday Night Special', ""What's Your Name""]"
"**Porter Wayne Wagoner** (August 12, 1927 – October 28, 2007) was an American country music singer. Famous for his flashy Nudie suits and blond pompadour, Wagoner introduced a young Dolly Parton to his long-running television show. Together, “Porter and Dolly” were a well-known duet team for many years. Parton wrote the song “I Will Always Love You” after Wagoner suggested she shift from story songs to focus on love songs.      His first band, The Blue Ridge Boys, performed on radio station KWPM from a butcher shop in his native West Plains, Missouri where Wagoner cut meat. Wagoner’s big break came in 1951, when he was hired as a performer by station KWTO in Springfield, Missouri. This led to a contract with RCA Records. With lagging sales, Wagoner and his trio played schoolhouses for the gate proceeds.      In 1953, his song entitled “Trademark” became a hit for Carl Smith, followed by a few hits of his own on RCA. He was a featured performer on ABC’s Ozark Jubilee and moved to Nashville and joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1957.      Wagoner was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2002. His 81 charted records include “Satisfied Mind” (#1, 1955), “Misery Loves Company” (#1, 1962), “I’ve Enjoyed As Much of This As I Can Stand” (#7, 1962–1963), “Sorrow on the Rocks” (#5, 1964), “Green, Green Grass of Home” (#4, 1965), “Skid Row Joe” (#3, 1965–1966), “The Cold Hard Facts of Life” (#2, 1967), and “The Carroll County Accident” (#2, 1968–1969). Among his hit duets with Dolly Parton were a cover of Tom Paxton’s “The Last Thing on My Mind” (1967), “We’ll Get Ahead Someday” (1968), “Just Someone I Used To Know” (1969), “Better Move it on Home” (1971), “Please Don’t Stop Loving Me” (#1, 1974) and “Making Plans” (#2, 1980). He also won three Grammy Awards for gospel recordings.      The Porter Wagoner Show ran on syndicated television from 1960 to 1981. There were 686 thirty minute episodes filmed, the first 104 being shot in black and white, the remainder in color. At its peak, it was featured in over 100 markets, with an average viewership of over three million. Reruns of the program currently air on the rural cable network RFD-TV.      Wagoner brought James Brown to the Grand Ole Opry, produced a rhythm & blues album for Joe Simon, and appeared in the Clint Eastwood film Honkytonk Man. [1] During the mid 1980s, Wagoner formed an all girl group called The Right Combination which was named after one of Porter and Dolly Parton’s hit records. He also hosted “Opry Backstage” during the 1990s on The Nashville Network where he interviewed guests. Though Parton’s departure caused some animosity on both sides, the two reconciled in the late 1980s and have appeared together a number of times in the years since; Parton inducted Wagoner into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2002.

"Marilyn Manson is an American rock band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States formed in 1989 by frontman Marilyn Manson and [Daisy Berkowitz](http://www.last.fm/music/Daisy+Berkowitz). The group was originally named [Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids](http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Manson+&+The+Spooky+Kids), with their theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s, until the band shortened the name in 1992. The band’s lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer (the only remaining original member), bassist [Twiggy Ramirez](http://www.last.fm/music/Twiggy+Ramirez), guitarist [Tyler Bates](http://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Bates), live guitarist [Paul Wiley](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Wiley), and drummer [Gil Sharone](http://www.last.fm/music/Gil+Sharone).      Until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer (e.g. [Marilyn Monroe](http://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Monroe) and [Charles Manson](http://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Manson)). The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing.      As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band’s mainstream popularity. Despite this, in June 2003, veteran rock journalist Jon Wiederhorn of MTV.com referred to Marilyn Manson as “the only true artist today,” and the frontman and band continues to have a strong cult following in 2015. Marilyn Manson has garnered much success: four of the band’s releases have achieved multi-platinum and three albums have gold, and the band has seen seven of its releases debut in the top ten, including two #1 albums. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records.   ______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________      —-HISTORY—-      **The Spooky Kids: 1989-1993**   In 1989, Brian Warner was a college student working toward a journalism degree, and gaining experience in the field by writing music articles for a South Florida lifestyle magazine, 25th Parallel.

"John Birks “Dizzy” Gillespie (October 21, 1917 – January 6, 1993) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, composer and occasional singer.      Dizzy Gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and improviser, building on the virtuoso style of [Roy Eldridge](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Eldridge) but adding layers of harmonic complexity previously unknown in jazz. His beret and horn-rimmed spectacles, his scat singing, his bent horn, pouched cheeks and his light-hearted personality were essential in popularizing bebop.   In the 1940s Gillespie, together with [Charlie Parker](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Parker), became a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz. He taught and influenced many other musicians, including trumpeters [Miles Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis), [Clifford Brown](http://www.last.fm/music/Clifford+Brown) and [Lee Morgan](http://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Morgan) a.o…      Gillespie was born in Cheraw, South Carolina, the youngest of nine children of James and Lottie Gillespie. James was a local bandleader, so instruments were made available to Dizzy. He started to play the piano at the age of four. Gillespie’s father died when the boy was only ten years old. Gillespie taught himself how to play the trombone as well as the trumpet by the age of twelve. From the night he heard his idol, Roy Eldridge, play on the radio, he dreamed of becoming a jazz musician. He received a music scholarship to the Laurinburg Institute in Laurinburg, North Carolina, which he attended for two years before accompanying his family when they moved to Philadelphia.   Gillespie’s first professional job was with the Frank Fairfax Orchestra in 1935, after which he joined the respective orchestras of Edgar Hayes and Teddy Hill, essentially replacing Roy Eldridge as first trumpet in 1937. Teddy Hill’s band was where Gillespie made his first recording, “King Porter Stomp”. In August 1937 while gigging with Hayes in Washington D.C., Dizzy met a young dancer named Lorraine Willis who worked a Baltimore–Philadelphia–New York circuit which included the Apollo Theatre. Willis was not immediately friendly but Gillespie was attracted anyway. The two finally married on May 9, 1940. They remained married until his death in 1993.   Dizzy stayed with Teddy Hill’s band for a year, then left and free-lanced with numerous other bands. In 1939, Gillespie joined Cab Calloway’s orchestra, with which he recorded one of his earliest compositions, the instrumental “Pickin’ the Cabbage”, in 1940. (Originally released on Paradiddle, a 78rpm backed with a co-composition with Cozy Cole, Calloway’s drummer at the time, on the Vocalion label, No. 5467).      Dizzy was fired by Calloway in late 1941, after a notorious altercation between the two. The incident is recounted by Gillespie, along with fellow Calloway band members Milt Hinton and Jonah Jones, in Jean Bach’s 1997 film, The Spitball Story",264575,jazz,"['bebop', 'big band', 'contemporary post-bop', 'cool jazz', 'hard bop', 'jazz', 'jazz fusion', 'jazz trumpet', 'soul jazz', 'swing', 'vocal jazz']",dizzy gillespie,53,"['On The Sunny Side Of The Street', 'All The Things You Are', 'Bang Bang', 'Unicorn', ""Groovin' High"", 'An Oscar For Treadwell - Incomplete 411-1', 'Manteca', 'Con Alma', 'Leap Frog - Take 11 / Take 6 / Master', 'Caravan']"

"Harry Haag James (March 15, 1916 – July 5, 1983) was a popular United States musician and band leader, and a well known trumpet virtuoso.      Harry James was born in Albany, Georgia, the son of a bandleader of a traveling circus. By age 10 he was taking trumpet lessons from his father. His father had him on a very strict practicing schedule every day. He was given one page to learn out of the Arban’s book (a trumpet drill book) every day and could not do anything until he learned that page.      In 1931 the family settled in Beaumont, Texas and James began playing with local dance bands. James joined the nationally popular Ben Pollack in 1935. At the start of 1937 he left Pollack to join Benny Goodman’s orchestra, where he stayed through 1938.      In February of 1939 Harry James debuted his own big band in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He continued touring with the band into the 1980s. His was the first “name band” to employ vocalist Frank Sinatra, in 1939. In 1943 he married actress Betty Grable.

"Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner CBE (born 2 October 1951 in Wallsend, Newcastle upon Tyne, England), known by his stage name Sting, is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, activist, actor and philanthropist. Prior to starting his solo career, he was the principal songwriter, lead singer and bassist for the rock band [The Police](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Police). Throughout his career, Sting has incorporated distinct elements of jazz, reggae, classical, New Age, and worldbeat into his music. As a solo musician and member of The Police, Sting has received sixteen Grammy Awards; receiving his first Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1981, three Brit Awards (including Best British Male in 1994), a Golden Globe, an Emmy Award, and several Oscar nominations for Best Original Song. He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.      Born Gordon Matthew Sumner, he is the eldest of four children. Sumner was raised in the Roman Catholic tradition, due to the influence of his paternal grandmother, who was from an Irish family. He attended St Cuthbert’s Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, and then the University of Warwick, but did not graduate. During this time, he often sneaked into nightclubs like the Club-a -Go-Go. Here he saw acts like [Jack Bruce](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Bruce) and [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix), who would later influence his music. After jobs as a bus conductor, a construction labourer, and a tax officer, he attended Northern Counties Teachers’ Training College, which later became part of Northumbria University, from 1971 to 1974. He then worked as a teacher at St Paul’s First School in Cramlington for two years.      From an early age, Sumner knew that he wanted to be a musician. His first music gigs were wherever he could get a job, performing evenings, weekends, and during vacations from college and teaching. He played with local jazz bands such as the Phoenix Jazzmen, the Newcastle Big Band, and Last Exit.      He gained his nickname while with the Phoenix Jazzmen. He once performed wearing a black and yellow jersey with hooped stripes that bandleader Gordon Solomon had noted made him look like a bumblebee; thus Sumner became “Sting”.      In January 1977, Sting moved from Newcastle to London, and soon thereafter he joined [Stewart Copeland](http://www.last.fm/music/Stewart+Copeland) and [Henry Padovani](http://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Padovani) (who was very soon replaced by [Andy Summers](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Summers)) to form the new wave band [The Police](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Police). The group had several chart-topping albums and won six Grammy Awards in the early 1980s.      Although they jumped on the punk bandwagon early in their career, The Police soon abandoned that sound in favor of reggae-tinged rock and minimalist pop.

"There are several artists named ‘Nirvana’;      **1) Nirvana** was an American [grunge](http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge) band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle [grunge](http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge) scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like [Pearl Jam](http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam), [Alice in Chains](http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains) and [Soundgarden](http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden). As their popularity rose, [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid ’90s.      In late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain’s Fecal Matter tape. After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of “[Love Buzz](http://www.last.fm/music/Shocking+Blue/_/Love+Buzz)”, a song by Dutch group ‘Shocking Blue’, was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label [Sub Pop](http://www.last.fm/label/Sub+Pop). Their debut album, _’[Bleach](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Bleach)’_, was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the _’[Blew EP](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Blew+EP)’_ with producer Steve Fisk.      At the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer [Butch Vig](http://www.last.fm/music/Butch+Vig), substituted their drummer by [Dave Grohl](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl) and signed to DGC Records. The result, _’[Nevermind](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind)’_, would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.      In early 1993, Nirvana released “Puss”/”Oh, the Guilt”, a split single with [The Jesus Lizard](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Jesus+Lizard), on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose [Steve Albini](http://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Albini) as the producer to record its third album. _’[In Utero](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero)’_ debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year.      As **Nirvana**’s frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the “spokesman of a generation”, with **Nirvana** the “flagship band” of “Generation X”, their third studio album _’[In Utero](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero)’_ was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While **Nirvana**’s mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band’s dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the [Meat Puppets](http://www.last",9402538,world,"['alternative rock', 'grunge', 'permanent wave', 'post-grunge', 'rock']",nirvana,81,"['Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Come As You Are', 'Heart-Shaped Box', 'Lithium', 'The Man Who Sold The World', 'In Bloom - Nevermind Version', 'All Apologies', 'Where Did You Sleep Last Night', 'Nirvana', 'About A Girl']"

The group evolved away from punk in 1989 for [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music. He realized his music tastes and growth were going in a different direction than his previous band’s vibe, and he broke off on his own.      His first album “_The Story So Far (aka Moby)_” featured the single “Go”, which gained popularity in many discos, and earned a spot on the [UK](http://www.last.fm/place/united%20kingdom) charts.

He released his solo debut album, “AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted,” in 1990 to critical and commercial success, although upon its release he was accused of racism and misogyny. He has since released 1991’s “Death Certificate”, 1992’s “The Predator”, 1993’s “Lethal Injection”, 1998’s “War & Peace Vol 1 (The War Disc)”, 2000’s “War & Peace Vol 2 (The Peace Disc)”, 2006’s “Laugh Now, Cry Later”, 2008’s “Raw Footage”, and 2010’s “I Am the West.”      Ice Cube was raised in South Central by his parents, both of whom were employed at UCLA. He began writing raps while attending William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California, most notably “Boyz ‘N Tha Hood”, which later became famous when done by N.W.A in 1986.      Cube and a friend, [Sir Jinx](http://www.last.fm/music/Sir+Jinx), rapped as a partnership called [C.I.A.](http://www.last.fm/music/C.I.A.) at parties hosted by [Dr. Dre](http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre). After a brief stint in a group called “[Hbo](http://www.last.fm/music/Hbo)”, Cube showed [Eazy-E](http://www.last.fm/music/Eazy-E) “Boyz ‘N Da Hood,” and the pair, plus Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, The Arabian Prince and [MC Ren](http://www.last.fm/music/MC+Ren), formed N.W.A.      Cube took one year off to earn a degree in architectural drafting in Phoenix in 1987 but returned in time to participate in N.W.A’s debut album, _Straight Outta Compton_.

His 1991 follow-up, _Death Certificate_, was even more controversial. A few songs in the album featured Cube’s hate of Uncle Sam and his politics, and a bonus track named “No Vaseline” was a diss to his former N.W.A bandmates. Also that year, he converted to the Nation of Islam.

"**George Benson** is a jazz guitarist born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA on 22 March 1943. He started out playing straight-ahead instrumental jazz with organist Jack McDuff. Benson got his first experience playing with his several-year stint with McDuff’s group. In 1964, at the age of 21, Benson recorded his first album as leader, The New Boss Guitar, with Brother Jack McDuff on organ.      Benson’s next recording was It’s Uptown with the George Benson Quartet with Lonnie Smith on organ and Ronnie Cuber on baritone sax. This album showcases Benson’s talent in constructing swinging bebop lines at blistering tempos. Benson followed it up with “The George Benson Cookbook,” also with Lonnie Smith and Ronnie Cuber.      One of his major hits is the song “This Masquerade”, which is included in the top-selling album Breezin’ . This album represents a shift to more commercially oriented music which brought Benson a wider audience but alienated some jazz fans. Other singles that have made the Billboard Hot 100 charts include “On Broadway” (1978), “Love Ballad” (1979), “Give Me The Night” (1980) and “Turn Your Love Around” (1982).      Benson continues to play outstanding jazz guitar, as evidenced on recordings such as Jimmy Smith’s Off the Top, Benson’s own live album Par Excellence, and Tenderly, on which Benson is accompanied by McCoy Tyner on piano.

The band is composed of [Thom Yorke](http://www.last.fm/music/Thom+Yorke) (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), [Jonny Greenwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonny+Greenwood) (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), [Ed O’Brien](http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+O%27Brien) (guitar, backing vocals), [Colin Greenwood](http://www.last.fm/music/Colin+Greenwood) (bass guitar) and [Phil Selway](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Phil+Selway) (drums, percussion).      **The early years (1992 – 1995)**   Radiohead released their first single, “[Creep](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Creep)” in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, [Pablo Honey](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Pablo+Honey) (1993). Radiohead’s popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, [The Bends](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends) (1995). The band’s textured guitar parts and Yorke’s falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans.      **International success (1996 - 2000)**   Radiohead’s third album, [OK Computer](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer) (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, [OK Computer](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer) has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.      **A change in style and leaving EMI (2000 – 2003)**   [Kid A](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Kid+A) (2000) and [Amnesiac](http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Amnesiac) (2001) marked a change in the band’s musical style.

"Charles (Charlie) Rich (December 14, 1932 – July 25, 1995) was an American country music singer and musician. His eclectic-style of music was often hard to classify in a single genre, encompassing in the rockabilly, jazz, blues, country, and gospel genres.   In the latter part of his life, Rich acquired the nickname The Silver Fox. He is perhaps best remembered for a pair of 1973 hits, “Behind Closed Doors” and “The Most Beautiful Girl”. “The Most Beautiful Girl” topped the U.S. country singles charts, as well as the pop singles charts and earned him two Grammy Awards.      Though he resided in Benton, Arkansas, from around 1960 to 1981, Rich was born in Colt, Arkansas, to rural cotton farmers. His professional musical career began while he was in the U.S. Air Force in the early 1950s. His first musical group, the Velvetones, played jazz and blues and featured his fiancée, Margaret Ann, on lead vocals. Rich left the military in 1955 and tried to farm five acres in Tennessee. He also began performing in clubs around the Memphis area, playing both jazz and R&B. It was during these hard times that he began writing his own material.      Rich was a session musician for Judd Records, owned by Judd Phillips, the brother of Sun Records founder Sam Phillips. After recording some demos for Sam Phillips at Sun Records that Phillips didn’t find commercial enough, and too jazzy, legend has it that he was given a stack of Jerry Lee Lewis records and told: “come back when you get that bad.” A September 6, 2010 NPR airing of 1992 interview with Fresh Air host Terry Gross Charlie Rich tells the story himself of Bill Justis telling Rich’s wife those exact words. In 1958, Rich became a regular session musician for Sun Records playing on records by Lewis, Johnny Cash, Bill Justis, Warren Smith, Billy Lee Riley, Carl Mann, and Ray Smith. He also wrote songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.   His third single for the Sun subsidiary, Phillips International Records, was the 1960 Top 30 hit, “Lonely Weekends,” noted for its Presley-like vocals. None of his seven follow-up singles was a success, though several of the songs became staples in his live set, including “Who Will the Next Fool Be,” “Sittin’ and Thinkin’,” and “No Headstone on My Grave.” These songs were often recorded by others to varying degrees of success, such as the Bobby Bland version of “Who Will the Next Fool Be.”   Rich’s career stalled, and he left the struggling Sun label in 1963, signing with a subsidiary of RCA Records, Groove. His first single for Groove, “Big Boss Man,” was a minor hit, but again his Chet Atkins-produced follow-ups all stiffed. Rich moved to Smash Records early in 1965. Rich’s new producer, Jerry Kennedy, encouraged the pianist to emphasize his country and rock & roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since his childhood",88397,blues,"['arkansas country', 'country', 'country gospel', 'country rock', 'cowboy western', 'nashville sound', 'outlaw country', 'rockabilly', 'traditional country']",charlie rich,52,"['Behind Closed Doors', 'The Most Beautiful Girl', 'The Most Beautiful Girl', 'Behind Closed Doors', ""Rollin' With the Flow"", ""Rollin' With The Flow"", 'Have A Heart', 'Behind Closed Doors', ""There Won't Be Anymore"", 'Life Has Its Little Ups And Downs']"
"**Roy Kelton Orbison** (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988), nicknamed “The Big O”, was an influential American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter) and a pioneer of [rock and roll](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll), whose recording career spanned more than four decades. By the mid-1960s Orbison was internationally recognized for his ballads of lost love, rhythmically advanced melodies, three-octave vocal range, characteristic dark sunglasses, and sometimes distinctive usage of [falsetto](http://www.last.fm/tag/falsetto), typified in songs such as “[Only the Lonely](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Orbison/_/Only+the+Lonely), “[Oh, Pretty Woman](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Orbison/_/Oh,+Pretty+Woman)”, and “[Crying](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Orbison/_/Crying)”. In 1989, he was inducted posthumously into the National Academy of Popular Music/Songwriters Hall of Fame.      Two common misconceptions about his appearance stubbornly continue to surface about Orbison: one, that he was an albino, and two, that he wore his trademark dark glasses because he was blind or nearly so. Neither is correct, although his poor vision required him to wear thick corrective lenses (He suffered from childhood from a combination of hyperopia, severe astigmatism, presbyopia, anisometropia, and strabismus). Orbison’s trademark sunglasses were a fashion statement arising from an accident early in his career. Due to go onstage in a few minutes, Orbison left his regular glasses in an airplane. Unable to see without corrective lenses, the only other pair of glasses he had available were darkly tinted prescription sunglasses. “I had to see to get onstage,” so he wore the glasses throughout his tour with the Beatles, and he carried on with it for the rest of his professional career. “I’ll just do this and look cool.”      **Early life and career**      Orbison was born in Vernon, Texas, the second son of Nadine and Orbie Lee. After moving to Fort Worth around 1943 to find work in the munitions and aircraft factories expanded as a result of the Second World War, the family moved to the tiny oil town of Wink in late 1946. Music was an important part of his family life.      In 1949, at age 13, he organized his first band, “The Wink Westerners”, and when not singing with the band he spent his time playing guitar and writing songs. The band appeared weekly on KERB radio in Kermit, Texas. Orbison graduated from Wink High School in 1954. He attended North Texas State College in Denton, Texas for a year, and enrolled at Odessa Junior College in 1955 to study history and English. The Wink Westerners had some success on local television, being given 30 minute weekly shows on KMID and then KOSA. One of the guests on their show was Johnny Cash, who advised them to seek a contract with his record producer, Sam Phillips, of Sun Records",758102,rock,"['adult standards', 'brill building pop', 'folk rock', 'mellow gold', 'rock', 'rock-and-roll', 'rockabilly', 'soft rock']",roy orbison,69,"['Oh, Pretty Woman', 'You Got It', 'Oh, Pretty Woman', 'Crying', 'Only the Lonely', 'I Drove All Night', 'In Dreams', ""It's Over"", 'You Got It', ""She's a Mystery to Me""]"
"**Daft Punk** is a multi Grammy Award-winning [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) music duo formed in 1994 in Paris, France, and consisting of [French](http://www.last.fm/tag/french) musicians [Thomas Bangalter](http://www.last.fm/music/Thomas+Bangalter) (born 3 January 1975) and [Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo](http://www.last.fm/music/Guy-Manuel+de+Homem-Christo) (born 8 February 1974). The band is considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim.       Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late [90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s) [house](http://www.last.fm/tag/house) movement in [France](http://www.last.fm/tag/france), along with other artists such as [Air](http://www.last.fm/music/Air), [Cassius](http://www.last.fm/music/Cassius), and [Dimitri from Paris](http://www.last.fm/music/Dimitri+from+Paris). Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter ([Busy P](http://www.last.fm/music/Busy+P)), the head of Ed Banger Records.      The group released four studio albums: _[Homework](http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Homework)_ (1997), _[Discovery](http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Discovery)_ (2001), _[Human After All](http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Human+After+All)_ (2005), and _[Random Access Memories](http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Random+Access+Memories)_ (2013).

The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group [Darlin’](http://www.last.fm/music/Darlin%27) with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums.

"**The Beach Boys** are an American [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) and [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock) band, widely considered one of the most influential groups of the ‘[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s). Known as “America’s Band”, they are easily recognized by their complex vocal harmonies. Initially recording music that focused on Californian youth culture, halfway through the decade they shifted their attention towards melancholy [orchestral](http://www.last.fm/tag/orchestral) pop, and continued to experiment with other genres. With the release of 1974’s [Endless Summer](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Endless+Summer) they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.      Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer- musician-composer [Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson), his brothers [Carl Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Wilson) and [Dennis Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Dennis+Wilson), their cousin [Mike Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Love), and friends [Al Jardine](http://www.last.fm/music/Al+Jardine) and [David Marks](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Marks). South African musicians [Blondie Chaplin](http://www.last.fm/music/Blondie+Chaplin) and [Ricky Fataar](http://www.last.fm/music/Ricky+Fataar) played and sang with the band on three key albums during the early 1970s. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: [Brian Wilson](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Wilson)’s mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group.      In December 2011, five of the group’s surviving members - Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David (But not Blondie or Ricky) - reformed in celebration of their 50th anniversary, announcing that a new album and a 50-date international tour had been planned for 2012. The tour begun in on April 24, 2012 with a headlining performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. [Songfacts](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=25961) reports that the first single from the album, That‘s Why God Made the Radio, made it’s national radio debut on April 25, 2012 on ESPN’s Mike and Mike in the Morning.      **Early Years**      The group was formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California under the leadership of Brian Wilson, and included his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine.

"Bill Monroe (September 13, 1911 – September 9, 1996) developed the style of country music known as bluegrass, which takes its name from his band, the “Blue Grass Boys,” named for his home state of Kentucky. Monroe’s performing career spanned 60 years as a singer, instrumentalist, composer and bandleader. He is often referred to as “the father of bluegrass.”      In the rock (and roll) community, Bill Monroe may be best known via one of Elvis Presley’s earliest recordings at Sun Records, that of Monroe’s ‘Blue Moon of Kentucky’.

"House of Pain was an Irish-styled American [hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag /hip-hop) group who released three albums in the early to mid 90’s before lead rapper [Everlast](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast) decided to pursue his solo career again. The group is best known for its 1992 hit single [Jump Around](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Jump+Around).      The band’s history starts with a failed short solo career, Everlast teamed up with [DJ Lethal](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Lethal) and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain. The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records, and their self-titled debut album (1992) went multi-platinum, spawning the successful [DJ Muggs](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Muggs) produced single [Jump Around](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Jump+Around).      Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative Judgement Night movie soundtrack.      Sophomore album and decline in popularity      Their follow-up effort, 1994’s Same As It Ever Was, went gold despite minimal airplay and no major hits. The first single, “On Point,” is noted for taking a swipe at another American rapper with a strong Irish heritage, Mark Wahlberg (“Calvin Klein’s no friend of mine/So I don’t like Marky”). Like [Cypress Hill](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill), who, with House of Pain, were a part of the loosely-affiliated Soul Assassins posse, they found urban radio airplay an increasingly closed path, which affected album sales.      Third album      House of Pain abruptly broke up in 1996 after the release of their third album, Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again, which featured guest appearances by rappers Sadat X of Brand Nubian, Guru of Gang Starr, producer/rapper Divine Styler and reggae singjay Cockni O’Dire (credited as the Scheme Team). On the release date of the album, Everlast announced his departure from the group.      Split, solo and current affairs      From this point on, the status of the group would seem to be in the past tense, though the members would continue their careers separately. Danny Boy would found an art company, DJ Lethal became a member of nu metal band Limp Bizkit, and Everlast would finally get multi-platinum solo fame in 1998. In that year his acoustic rock/blues-inflected Whitey Ford Sings the Blues album hit the charts, together with the single “What It’s Like”. In 2000, a feud between Everlast and rapper Eminem coincided with the gold-selling Eat at Whitey’s, which had minor hits like “Black Jesus” and “Black Coffee”, and featured a collaboration with Carlos Santana.

"William Thomas Dupree (birth date disputed; died January 21, 1992, in Hanover, Germany), best known as Champion Jack Dupree, was an American blues pianist. He was the embodiment of the New Orleans blues and boogie woogie pianist. On his best known album, [Blues from the Gutter](http://www.last.fm/music/Champion+Jack+Dupree/Blues+from+the+Gutter), for Atlantic in 1959, he was accompanied on guitar by [Larry Dale](http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Dale), whose playing on that record inspired [Brian Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Jones) of [The Rolling Stones](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones). Although best known as a singer and pianist in the New Orleans style, Dupree occasionally pursued more musically adventurous projects, including Dupree `n` McPhee, a collaboration with English guitarist [Tony McPhee](http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+McPhee).      Dupree’s birth date is disputed, given as July 4, July 10, and July 23, in the years 1908, 1909, or 1910. He died January 21, 1992, in Hanover, Germany. Dupree’s playing is almost all straight blues and boogie woogie, with no ballads or pop songs, not even blues ballads. He was not a sophisticated musician or singer, but he had a wry and clever way with words: “Mama, move your false teeth, papa wanna scratch your gums.” He sometimes sang as if he had a cleft palate and even recorded under the name Harelip Jack Dupree. This was an artistic conceit, as Dupree had excellent clear articulation, particularly for a blues singer.      He sang about life as he found it, singing about jail, drinking, drug addiction, although he himself was a light drinker and did not use other drugs. His “Junker’s Blues” is still sung in New Orleans, and was also transmogrified by Fats Domino into his first hit “The Fat Man”. Dupree’s songs included not only gloomy topics, such as “TB Blues” and “Angola Blues” (about the infamous Louisiana prison farm), but also cheerful subjects like the “Dupree Shake Dance”: “Come on, mama, on your hands and knees, do that shake dance as you please”.      On his best known LP, 1958’s “Blues from the Gutter” for Atlantic, he was accompanied on guitar by Larry Dale, whose playing on that LP inspired Brian Jones (of Rolling Stones fame) (“Yeah! I have to play this… what a sound”).      It seemed that Dupree could not escape from the prejudice and racism anywhere he settled in the United States. Finally in late 1958, he decided to move to Europe. Over the next 32 years, he lived in a number of locales in Switzerland, France, England, Denmark and Germany. He also recorded a multitude of wonderful albums during this time for a long list of European labels. Among these is the outstanding live recording, “Blues at Montreaux” on Atco that also featured sax great, King Curtis.      He died from complications of cancer on January 21, 1992 in Hanover. As one of the most prolific recording Bluesmen of all time, he left a large catalog of material",15971,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'electric blues', 'louisiana blues', 'memphis blues', 'new orleans blues', 'piano blues', 'rhythm and blues', 'traditional blues']",champion jack dupree,37,"[""Junker's Blues"", ""Drinkin' Wine Spodie-Odie"", 'One Scotch, One Bourbon, One Beer - Bonus track', 'Evil Woman', 'Ooh la la', 'Bad Blood', ""Can't Kick the Habit"", 'Stack-O-Lee', 'Nasty Boogie', ""Strollin'""]"
"**Pink Floyd** are a [psychedelic](http://www.last.fm/tag/psychedelic)/[progressive rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock) band formed in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom in 1965. Pink Floyd is one of [rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/rock)’s most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time.

The band’s classic lineup was [Roger Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Waters) (vocals, bass), [David Gilmour](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Gilmour) (vocals, guitar), [Rick Wright](http://www.last.fm/music/Rick+Wright) (organ, keyboards, vocals) and [Nick Mason](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Mason) (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band’s founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter [Syd Barrett](http://www.last.fm/music/Syd+Barrett), who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour’s addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, [avant- garde](http://www.last.fm/tag/avant-garde) compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows.      Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett’s increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after _[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Piper+at+the+Gates+of+Dawn)_ with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973’s _[The Dark Side Of The Moon](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+Of+The+Moon)_ (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975’s _[Wish You Were Here](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Wish+You+Were+Here)_, 1977’s _[Animals](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Animals)_, and 1979’s _[The Wall](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Wall)_, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.      Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members — guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright — formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band’s primary vocalist as well",10240396,classic,"['album rock', 'art rock', 'classic rock', 'progressive rock', 'psychedelic rock', 'rock', 'symphonic rock']",pink floyd,82,"['Wish You Were Here', 'Comfortably Numb', 'Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2', 'Money', 'Time', 'Breathe (In the Air)', 'Hey You', 'Comfortably Numb - Live', 'Brain Damage', 'Us and Them']"
"Tony Bennett (born Anthony Dominick Benedetto on August 3, 1926) is an American singer of popular music, standards and jazz. After having achieved artistic and commercial success in the 1950s and early 1960s, his career suffered an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era. Bennett staged a remarkable comeback, however, in the late 1980s and 1990s, expanding his audience to a younger generation while keeping his musical style intact. He remains a popular and critically praised recording artist and concert performer in the 2010s.      Bennett is also an accomplished painter, creating works under his birth name, Anthony Benedetto.      **Early life**   Anthony Benedetto was born in Astoria, Queens, New York City, the son of Ann (née Suraci) and John Benedetto.[1] His father was a grocer who had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria, and his mother was a seamstress.[2] With two other children and a father who was ailing and unable to work, the family grew up in poverty.[3] John Benedetto died when Anthony was 10 years old.[3]      The young Benedetto grew up listening to Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Judy Garland and Bing Crosby as well as jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden and Joe Venuti. An uncle was a tap dancer in vaudeville, giving him an early window into show business.[4] By age 10 he was already singing and performed at the opening of the Triborough Bridge.[5] Drawing and caricatures were also an early passion of his.[3] He attended New York’s High School of Industrial Art where he studied painting and music,[2] but dropped out at age 16 to help support his family.[6] He then set his sights on a professional singing career, performing as a singing waiter in several Queens Italian restaurants.[7]      **World War II and after**   His singing career was interrupted when Benedetto was drafted into the United States Army in November 1944 during the final stages of World War II.[3][8] He did basic training at Fort Dix and Fort Robinson, encountering bigotry due to his Italian heritage, and became an infantry rifleman.[9] Processed through the huge Le Havre “repple depple” replacement depot, in January 1945 he was assigned as a replacement infantryman to 255th Infantry Regiment of the 63rd Infantry Division, a unit filling in for heavy losses after the Battle of the Buldge.[10] He moved across France and into Germany,[3] and as March 1945 began he joined the front line and what he would later describe as a “front- row seat in hell.”[10]      As the German Army was pushed back into their homeland, Benedetto and his company saw bitter fighting in cold winter conditions, often hunkering down in foxholes as German 88 mm guns fired on them",450414,jazz,"['adult standards', 'easy listening', 'lounge', 'vocal jazz']",tony bennett,65,"['(I Left My Heart) In San Francisco', 'The Way You Look Tonight', 'One for My Baby (And One More for the Road)', 'Anything Goes', ""'S Wonderful"", 'Rags to Riches - Remastered', 'Cheek To Cheek', 'Body and Soul', 'Body And Soul', ""It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)""]"
"Dave Matthews Band was formed in Charlottesville, VA in 1991 by South African native singer and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, the late LeRoi Moore, who played a wide variety of instruments from the saxophone to the flute, violin player Boyd Tinsley, drummer Carter Beauford, and keyboardist Peter Griesar (who left the band in 1993), all of whom Dave met in Charlottesville. In 1998, the band played shows with keyboardist Butch Taylor, although he was not officially a member of the band. Taylor played with the band for the stadium runs of the 1999 and 2000 summer tours. From May 18th, 2001 on, Taylor was a permanent fixture on stage, and in 2003 was no longer listed as “special guest”. Even though he was never officially part of the lineup, the band recently announced that Butch was leaving the band via their website, and the 2008 summer tour had some of the first shows without Taylor in years. Rashawn Ross has performed at every normal show from 12.13.05 until the present, leading some to believe that he has joined the band, at least semi-permanently. It is also confirmed that Ross was in the studio with the band during the recent sessions. As of early 2009, Ross, long time collaborator Tim Reynolds, and new saxophonist Jeff Coffin are listed as “Touring Members”.      Early 1990s      In the early 1990s, the band established a cult following through relentless touring with weekly stops at Virginia clubs known as Trax and Floodzone, an active taping community, and an independent LP, [Remember Two Things](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/Remember+Two+Things). (Keyboardist Griesar left the band in 1993, shortly before the release of “Remember Two Things”.) After signing to RCA Records, Dave Matthews Band, under the direction of producer Steve Lillywhite, released [Under The Table And Dreaming](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/Under+The+Table+And+ Dreaming) in 1994, a critical and popular smash that firmly established the band’s style of pop-rock with improvisational leanings. Under the Table and Dreaming would be the first of three albums released under Lillywhite’s direction. This was followed by [Crash](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/Crash) (1996). For most of America, Crash was the record that put the Dave Matthews Band on the map. Featuring the hit single “[Crash into Me](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/Crash+into+Me)”, as well as fan-favorites such as “[Two Step](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/Two+Step)”, “[Tripping Billies](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/Tripping+Billies)”, and the Grammy-winning “[So Much To Say](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Matthews+Band/_/So+Much+To+Say)”, Crash would go on to be the band’s best selling album.

"**The Rolling Stones** are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the “British Invasion” of the mid-[60s](http://www.last.fm/tag/60s). Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine’s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on “The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists”, and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.      The group was formed by [Brian Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Jones), [Mick Jagger](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Jagger), [Keith Richards](http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Richards) and [Ian Stewart](http://www.last.fm/music/Ian+Stewart), who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a [Muddy Waters](http://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Waters) song called “Rollin’ Stone Blues”, and made their live debut at London’s Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. [Bill Wyman](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Wyman) joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).      In January 1963, [Charlie Watts](http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Watts) joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer’s Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham. Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond’s Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the “Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone” press campaign, which set the tone for their career.      In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later “Come On”, the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.      The fifth member of the group, [Brian Jones](http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Jones), left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by [Mick Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Taylor), formerly in [John Mayall](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayall)’s Bluesbreakers.      In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label. In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career. He was replaced in 1975 by [Ronnie Wood](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ronnie+Wood).

"**Underworld** are a British [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) group formed in 1986 in Romford, Essex, England, by _Karl Hyde_ (vocals, guitar, production) and _Rick Smith_ (keyboards, production), assisted by _Darren Price_ (keyboards, production) when playing live. They are best known for their unique mix of [techno](http://www.last.fm/tag/techno), [trance](http://www.last.fm/tag/trance), [dance](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance), [ambient](http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient) and sometimes [drum and bass](http://www.last.fm/tag/drum%20and%20bass), the vocal parts performed by Hyde as spoken-word streams of consciousness, and for their outstanding live shows. The band gained worldwide fame with [Born Slippy .NUXX](http://www.last.fm/music/Underworld/_/Born+Slippy+.NUXX) from Trainspotting soundtrack.      Before Underworld, Hyde and Smith started out in 1979 on [The Screen Gemz](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Screen+Gemz) band while working together in a diner in the city of Cardiff, where both had been studying. In 1983 they recorded two albums for CBS Records with a proto-electroclash new romantic band whose name was a graphic squiggle, later entitled [Freur](http://www.last.fm/music/Freur).      In 1986 Hyde and Smith formed Underworld, after disbanding of Freur. They tried a more guitar-oriented funky electropop sound on their two albums released on Sire Records: _[Underneath the Radar](http://www.last.fm/music/Underworld/Underneath+the+Radar)_ (1987) and _[Change the Weather](http://www.last.fm/music/Underworld/Change+the+Weather)_ (1989). This initial lineup (also called Underworld Mk1) consisted of Karl Hyde, Rick Smith, Alfie Thomas, Bryn Burrows, Baz Allen and Pascal Consoli before sinking back into obscurity and disbanding in 1990.      British DJ [Darren Emerson](http://www.last.fm/music/Darren+Emerson) hooked up with Hyde and Smith in 1992 and helped them refine their sound into something more sleek and beat-oriented, yet still shot through with tinges of blues, rock and spoken-word streams of consciousness. After several releases on [Junior Boy’s Own](http://www.last.fm/label/Junior+Boy%27s+Own) as [Lemon Interupt](http://www.last.fm/music/Lemon+Interupt), the trio re-adopted the Underworld name in 1992. Two songs from this era are [Rez](http://www.last.fm/music/Underworld/_/Rez) and [Spikee](http://www.last.fm/music/Underworld/_/Spikee).      In addition to their music, Hyde and Smith are members of Tomato, a graphic design company which has done high-profile work for clients around the world as well as art for all of Underworld’s releases. Hyde, along with former Freur keyboardist John Warwicker, has also published two typographic journals, _Mmm… Skyscraper, I Love You_ (1994) and _In The Belly Of Saint Paul_ (2003).

"A perennial favorite as the best DJ in the world according to fans as well as the major mixing magazines, Carl Cox has been a part of Britain’s dance scene from the heady days of disco through to the global clubland of the new millennium, with temporary pit stops covering hip-hop, the rare groove movement, and the immense rave revolution of the late ’80s. That large span of time has undoubtedly affected his choice of records, since Cox routinely detours through breakbeat, Italian house, and the dance mainstream during his usual sets of hard techno. Perhaps the best testament to his mixing skills is his immense popularity despite his focus on music much more intense than the brand of arena trance spawned by Oakenfold, Sasha, Digweed, and others.      Cox was born in Oldham in 1962, to parents originally from Barbados (they later moved back after he grew up). Cox began DJing family get-togethers at the age of eight, selecting records from his parents’ stack of soul 45s. He was buying his own records soon after, and owned his first pair of turntables at the age of 15. The rest of his teens was spent making spare money at any event he could DJ; though Cox studied electrical engineering in college, he quit after six months and began working various jobs until he could become a full-time DJ.      Cox had followed the musical trends from disco to rare groove on to hip-hop during the late ’70s and early ’80s, but the introduction of house into Britain during the middle part of the decade convinced him that he had found his niche. After moving to Brighton in 1986, his reputation bloomed during the acid house explosion of 1988-1989; Cox played the opening night at Shoom, one of the defining club nights of Britain’s house revolution (as well as other legendary hot spots like Land of Oz and Spectrum). In front of 15,000 at the 1989 open-air event Sunrise, he unveiled his use of three decks on the mix; that signature technique built him into one of the top DJs of the late ’80s and early ’90s.      By 1992 Cox had signed an unheard-of long-term production deal with Paul Oakenfold’s Perfecto Records and hit number 23 on the British charts with his debut single, “I Want You (Forever).” His second single, “Does It Feel Good to You,” also reached the Top 40, and he quickly diversified by setting up his own record label (Worldwide Ultimatum) and an international DJ agency (Ultimate). The onset of a more hardcore rave sound (and the fact that he was increasingly becoming pigeonholed within it) forced Cox to spend several years reestablishing his niche. In a bit of irony, commercial successes like Cox’s own steered him away from high-BPM candy-core and toward the still soulful house and techno scene.      Three years after his hit singles, Cox returned with the first volume in what became a genre-defining mix compilation series, F.A.C.T.: Future Alliance of Communications and Tecknology",432692,soul,"['house', 'minimal techno', 'schranz', 'tech house', 'uk tech house']",carl cox,57,"[""Dr. Funk (Riva Starr Mo' Funk Mix)"", 'Finder - Carl Cox Remix Edit', 'I Want You (Forever) - Josh Butler Remix - Radio Edit', 'Inferno', 'Lost - Carl Cox Remix', 'This Is Our Time - Filth Mix', 'The First Step - Carl Cox Remix', ""Dr. Funk (Riva Starr Mo' Disco Remix)"", 'Your Light Shines On', ""See You Next Tuesday - Danny Tenaglia's Return to Twilo Mix""]"
"Sean John Combs (born November 4, 1969, New York, New York) is a famous record producer and entertainment mogul who presides over a media empire that includes the record label Bad Boy Entertainment, the clothing lines Sean John and Sean by Sean Combs, a movie production company, and a restaurant chain. He has taken the roles of recording executive, producer, writer, arranger, clothing designer, actor, singer and rapper.      Early years      Combs was born in the public housing projects of the Harlem neigborhood of New York City, the son of Janice and Melvin Combs. He grew up in Mount Vernon. When Combs was a child, his father, aged 33, an associate of Frank Lucas the New York drug lord, was shot dead in his car at a Manhattan park after attending a party. Lucas and rival gangster Nicky Barnes both publicly state that they were close to Melvin.      Combs played football at the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy. He played defense and, in 1986 when he was a senior, his team won a division title. Combs has “fond memories” of his high school buddies, one of whom (the team quarterback) was Andrew Campos, a reputed Gambino crime family enforcer. Combs is not alleged, either in court papers or by law enforcement sources, to have engaged in any wrongdoing in any of his dealings with Campos. He completed his secondary education in 1987.      Combs says he was given the nickname “Puff” as a child because he would “huff and puff” when he was angry,and “Daddy” was another version of “player.”         Uptown Records      Combs attended Howard University in Washington, DC, where he showed a penchant for marketing and gained a reputation as a party promoter. He eventually became an intern at New York’s Uptown Records.[5] For some time he would travel back and forth between Washington and New York, juggling his classes and his internship, before eventually dropping out of Howard when he became a top executive at Uptown. He was instrumental in developing Jodeci and signing and producing Mary J. Blige.      In 1991 Combs promoted a concert, headlined by Heavy D. and held at the City College of New York gymnasium, following an AIDS charity basketball game. The event was overcrowded since it was oversold to almost twice capacity, while thousands without tickets were outside. To keep them out Combs’ people shut the only door to a stairwell and put a table behind it, though the crowd jammed inside was pounding on the door and pleading for help. When the crowd outside broke several glass doors in an attempt to get in a stampede ensued inside the gymnasium in which nine people died. In a 1999 ruling, a Court of Claims judge found Puff Daddy and Heavy D. responsible for 50 percent of the incident. City College bore the rest of the responsibility in part for abandoning security responsibility to Puff Daddy though they knew the event was oversold",1060596,,"['conscious hip hop', 'hip hop', 'pop rap', 'rap', 'southern hip hop', 'trap music']",puff daddy,78,"['Young Nigga (feat.

"Gertrude Pridgett Rainey, better known as **Ma Rainey** (Columbus, Georgia, April 26, 1886 – Columbus, Georgia, December 22, 1939), was one of the earliest known professional [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) singers and one of the first generation of such singers to record. She was billed as The Mother of the Blues. She did much to develop and popularize the form and was an important influence on younger blues women, such as [Bessie Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Bessie+Smith), and their careers.      She first appeared on stage in Columbus in “A Bunch of Blackberries” at the age of 14. She then joined a traveling vaudeville troupe, the Rabbit Foot Minstrels. After hearing a blues song at a theater in St. Louis sung by a local girl in 1902, she started performing in a blues style. She claimed at that time that she was the one who coined the name “blues” for the style that she specialized in. Musicians and singers who had sang and played in the style said there were no such origins and that the blues had always been. A pioneer in the style, [Bunk Johnson](http://www.last.fm/music/Bunk+Johnson) said that in the 1880s the blues had already been developed.      She married fellow vaudeville singer William ‘Pa’ Rainey in 1904, changing her name to **Ma Rainey**. The pair toured with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels as Rainey & Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues, singing a mix of blues and popular songs. In 1912, she took the young [Bessie Smith](http://www.last.fm/music/Bessie+Smith) into the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, trained her, and worked with her until Smith left in 1915.      Also known, though less discussed, is the fact that she was bisexual. Rainey never shied away from her feelings in her music, as is apparent in the lyrics of “Prove It On Me”:      “Went out last night with a crowd of my friends,   They must have been women, ‘cause I don’t like no men.   Wear my clothes just like a fan, Talk to gals just like any old man   ‘Cause they say I do it, ain’t nobody caught me, Sure got to prove it on me.”      Rainey was outspoken on women’s issues and a role model for future women entertainers who took control of their own careers.      **Ma Rainey** was already a veteran performer with decades of touring with African-American shows in the U.S. Southern States when she made her first recordings in 1923. Rainey signed with Paramount Records and, between 1923 and 1928, she recorded 100 songs, sometimes accompanied such [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) notables as [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong), [Kid Ory](http://www.last.fm/music/Kid+Ory), [Fletcher Henderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Fletcher+Henderson) and others. Rainey was extremely popular among southern blacks in the 1920s, but the Great Depression and changing tastes ended her career by 1933, when she retired.      Rainey died of a heart attack in 1939.      The 1982 August Wilson play Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom was based on her.

"Bad Company is a 1970s British blues-rock group fronted by Paul “The Voice” Rodgers. Their name came from a ‘70s Western movie and they were formed by former members of [Mott the Hoople](http://www.last.fm/music/Mott+the+Hoople), [Free](http://www.last.fm/music/Free), and [King Crimson](http://www.last.fm/music/King+Crimson).

Their hits include “Shooting Star,” “Bad Company,” “Feel Like Makin’ Love,” “Rock ‘N’ Roll Fantasy,” “Ready for Love,” and “Can’t Get Enough,” most of which are off of the albums Straight Shooter and Bad Company.      In the mid 80`s Rodgers & Burrell left the band. New singer Brian Howe, who had worked with Ted Nugent earlier, made 4 albums with the band. Year 1990`s LP Holy water contained big hit “If you needed somebody”. Their style was then more like melodic rock.      In mid 1990`s Howe left the band and solo artist Robert Hart replaced him. Also other guitarist Dave Colwell & basist Rick Wills joined to group. In 2000`s Paul Rodgers came back to make the new album with old band members Kirke, Ralphs & other guys. They got a hit with the song “Joe Fabulous” what was number 1 on Classic Rock Radio. After that recording all original members left the band and new line-up members came to band.

"Paul Smith ([Spinback](http://www.last.fm/music/Spinback)) and Jason Greenhalgh ([Q Project](http://www.last.fm/music/Q+Project)) are two of the most prolific producers within the drum & bass movement, recording for a plethora of different labels under a range of monikers. The pair first met in 1987, both living on Blackbird Leys estate in Oxford, England and brought together through a mutual love of hip-hop. Distracted by the arrival of hardcore in the early nineties, record collecting was quickly followed by DJ’ing and eventually production. Greenhalgh was the first into the studio, with “Freestyle Fanatic” launching his career in 1991. However it was the establishment of the Legend imprint and specifically Greenhalgh’s “Champion Sound”, which really took their profile above and beyond the slew of anonymous white labels that were dominating the music at the time.   In 1994, the pair started recording together, with “Got to Believe” the first in a series of records which pushed the label away from the fizzling darkside movement and more towards the epic string sections and rolling beats which started to appear on labels like Lucky Spin, Basement and Good Looking. After six years of recording singles for others, the pair established the CIA label in the closing months of 1997 with the help of Brillo from Timeless. The release of their Silent Reign EP for Goldie’s Metalheadz breathed a new lease of life into the project, and the pair achieved a further boost with a well- timed Bad Company remix of “Champion Sound” which conjured further interest in what they were doing at their own label. Their debut album Advance exposed a further field of interest, with downtempo experiments logged as a series of “Breaks” on the majority of their early EP’s extended to some superb deep house, this breadth taken a step further with their Skin Deep imprint which has forged broken beat to considerable acclaim. Their pioneering of a revival in old-school sounds and arrangements, together with Digital and Reinforced, dominated drum & bass throughout 2001.      and a darn good lookin couple o’ chaps n’ all.

"William Henry Webb, usually known as Chick Webb (February 10, 1905 –June 16, 1939) was a jazz and swing music drummer as well as a band leader.      Chick Webb represented the triumph of the human spirit in jazz and life. Hunchbacked, small in stature, almost a dwarf with a large face and broad shoulders, Webb fought off congenital tuberculosis of the spine in order to become one of the most competitive drummers and band leaders of the big band era. Perched high upon a platform, he used custom-made pedals, goose-neck cymbal holders, a 28-inch bass drum and a wide variety of other percussion instruments to create thundering solos of a complexity and energy that paved the way for [Buddy Rich](http://www.last.fm/music/Buddy+Rich) (who studied Webb intensely) and [Louie Bellson](http://www.last.fm/music/Louie+Bellson).      William Henry Webb bought his first set of drums with his earnings as a newsboy, and he began playing in bands on pleasure boats. After moving to New York in 1925, he led bands in various clubs before settling in for long regular runs at the Savoy beginning in 1931. Although [Benny Carter](http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Carter) and [Johnny Hodges](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Hodges) played with the band early on, the Webb band was oddly short on major soloists during its heyday from the mid-’30s onward; the young alto sax player [Louis Jordan](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Jordan) made the biggest impression after leaving the band. But the band made up for it with a crisp ensemble sound, Webb’s disciplined, ferociously driving drum pyrotechnics, trumpeter [Taft Jordan](http://www.last.fm/music/Taft+Jordan)’s impressions of [Louis Armstrong](http://www.last.fm/music/Louis+Armstrong), and most of all, a series of strong compositions and charts by Edgar Sampson (“Blue Lou” and “Stomping at the Savoy” among them). In 1935, Webb hired the teenaged [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald) after she won a talent contest at the Apollo Theatre, became her legal guardian, and rebuilt his show around the singer, who provided him with his biggest hit record, “A Tisket-A-Tasket,” in 1938. The band’s fame continued to grow, fueled by its reputation as a giant-killer in the Savoy battles and a continuous string of Decca 78s that featured such irresistible numbers as “T’aint What You Do (It’s the Way That You Do It)” and the B-side of “Tasket,” “Liza.” But Webb’s precarious health began to give way, and after a major operation in Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, he died (his last words reportedly were, “I’m sorry, I’ve got to go.”). After Webb’s death, Fitzgerald fronted the the band until it finally broke up in 1942.

"Hank Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953), born Hiram King Williams, was an American [singer-songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer- songwriter) and musician regarded as the most important [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) music artist of all time. Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that would place in the Top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one.      Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams moved to Georgiana, where he met Rufus Payne, a black street performer who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals. Payne had a major influence on Williams’s later musical style. During this time, Williams informally changed his name to Hank, believing it to be a better name for country music. After moving to Montgomery, Williams began his career in 1937 when WSFA radio station producers hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed as backup the Drifting Cowboys band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote all of his time to his career.      When several of his band members were conscripted to military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements and started drinking heavily, causing WSFA to dismiss him. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who became his manager for nearly a decade. After recording “Never Again” and “Honky Tonkin’” with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1948 he released “Move it on Over,” which became a hit, and also joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program. In 1949, he released a cover of “Lovesick Blues,” which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He had 11 number one songs between 1948 and 1953, though he was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” “Hey, Good Lookin’,” and “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry.”      During his last years Williams’s consumption of alcohol, morphine and other painkillers severely compromised his professional and personal life. He divorced his wife and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry due to frequent drunkenness. Williams died suddenly in the early morning hours of New Years Day in 1953 at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams has had a major influence on country music. The songs he wrote and recorded have been covered by numerous artists, many of whom have also had hits with the tunes, in a range of pop, gospel, blues and rock styles.      Alabama governor Gordon Persons officially proclaimed September 21 “Hank Williams Day”. The first celebration, in 1954 featured the unveiling of a monument at the Cramton Bowl, that was later placed in the grave site of Williams. The ceremony featured Ferlin Husky interpreting “I Saw the Light”",617652,blues,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'country rock', 'nashville sound', 'outlaw country', 'traditional country']",hank williams,67,"['A Country Boy Can Survive', 'Family Tradition', 'Dinosaur', 'Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound', ""If Heaven Ain't A Lot Like Dixie"", 'A Country Boy Can Survive', 'Family Tradition', ""Hey, Good Lookin' - Single Version"", ""Bartender (Sittin' At A Bar)"", 'Jambalaya (On The Bayou) - Single Version']"
"Creedence Clearwater Revival (sometimes shortened to Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band that gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a number of successful singles drawn from various albums. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter [John Fogerty](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Fogerty), his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed country rock and swamp rock genres; it remains a staple of radio airplay worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and were ranked at 82 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.      The band started out as [The Blue Velvets](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blue+Velvets), formed by John Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook in El Cerrito, California, United States in the late 1950s. They were an instrumental trio, however during the early ’60s they began backing Tom Fogerty, John’s older brother, for school dances at El Cerrito High School, on fraternity house gigs and in the recording studio. By the mid 1960s, the band signed a contract with Fantasy Records which was a local label based in San Francisco at that time. They were attracted to the label because Fantasy had released a national hit by Vince Guaraldi, “Cast Your Fate To The Wind”. Fantasy officials changed the group’s name to The Golliwogs, an apparent reference to a once-popular minstrel doll called a Golliwogg. Seven singles were released in the San Francisco Bay area, but none received national attention (however, in 1975 Fantasy released Pre-Creedence, a compilation album of recordings by The Golliwogs).      Eventually John Fogerty took control of the group, writing most of their material and singing lead vocals. The band’s first album as Creedence Clearwater Revival was released in 1968. A cover of the Dale Hawkins Swamp Rock classic “Suzie Q.” became their first hit single (the song was later featured in the movie Apocalypse Now). As a result, Creedence Clearwater Revival is considered part of that distinctly American Swamp Rock music, exemplified again most prominently in their song “Born On The Bayou”.      By 1969, the band really began to find its voice; “Proud Mary” became their second hit single and also was a big hit for Ike and Tina Turner. It was followed by a series of successful songs, including “Bad Moon Rising”, “Green River”, “Down on the Corner”, “Travelin’ Band”, “Who’ll Stop the Rain?”, “Have You Ever Seen the Rain?”, “Up Around the Bend”, “Fortunate Son”, and “Lookin’ Out My Back Door.”      Due to John Fogerty’s success as writer, singer, and frontman, the other band members began to feel like they were being held back.

"San Mateo native Rasco (whose name is an acronym for “realistic, ambitious, serious, cautious, and organized”) worked as a member of the West Coast hip- hop groups Various Blends and Cali Agents. His deep voice and straight-ahead rap style came to the public’s attention with his 1997 12” The Unassisted, which earned him several honors including number one on the Bay Area Hip-Hop Coalition chart, number one on the independent hip-hop chart in Hits magazine, and number one on Sway and King Tech’s nationally syndicated Wake Up Show for four weeks straight. His debut album, Time Waits for No Man, was released in 1998 on Stones Throw with a production team that included Paul Nice, Peanut Butter Wolf, and Evidence of the group Dilated Peoples. The follow-up EP The Birth arrived in 1999. Moving from Stones Throw to Copasetik, Rasco released Hostile Environment (2001) and Presents Hip-Hop Classics, Vol. 1 (2003), but after a falling-out with the label, he left to start his own, Pocketslinted, in 2004. That same year he issued the compilations 20,000 Leagues Under the Street, Vol. 1 (a re-release from 2000) and Minority Report, and in 2005 his solo effort The Dick Swanson Theory came out.

"Born James Fletcher Henderson December 18th, 1897, in Cuthbert, Georgia and died December 28th, 1952 due to a stroke.      Fletcher Henderson was very important to early jazz as leader of the first great jazz big band, as an arranger and composer in the 1930s, and as a masterful talent scout. Between 1923-1939, quite an all-star cast of top young black jazz musicians passed through his orchestra, including trumpeters Louis Armstrong, Joe Smith, Tommy Ladnier, Rex Stewart, Bobby Stark, Cootie Williams, Red Allen, and Roy Eldridge; trombonists Charlie Green, Benny Morton, Jimmy Harrison, Sandy Williams, J.C. Higginbottham, and Dickie Wells; clarinetist Buster Bailey; tenors Coleman Hawkins (1924-1934), Ben Webster, Lester Young (whose brief stint was not recorded), and Chu Berry; altoists Benny Carter, Russell Procope, and Hilton Jefferson; bassists John Kirby and Israel Crosby; drummers Kaiser Marshall, Walter Johnson, and Sid Catlett; guest pianist Fats Waller; and such arrangers as Don Redman, Benny Carter, Edgar Sampson, and Fletcher’s younger brother Horace Henderson. And yet, at the height of the swing era, Henderson’s band was little-known.      Fletcher Henderson had a degree in chemistry and mathematics, but when he came to New York in 1920 with hopes of becoming a chemist, the only job he could find (due to the racism of the times) was as a song demonstrator with the Pace-Handy music company. Harry Pace soon founded the Black Swan label, and Henderson, a versatile but fairly basic pianist, became an important contributor behind the scenes, organizing bands and backing blues vocalists. Although he started recording as a leader in 1921, it was not until January 1924 that he put together his first permanent big band. Using Don Redman’s innovative arrangements, he was soon at the top of his field. His early recordings (Henderson made many records during 1923-1924) tend to be both futuristic and awkward, with strong musicianship but staccato phrasing. However, after Louis Armstrong joined up in late 1924 and Don Redman started contributing more swinging arrangements, the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra had no close competitors artistically until the rise of Duke Ellington in 1927. By then, Henderson’s band (after a period at the Club Alabam) was playing regularly at the Roseland Ballroom but, due to the bandleader being a very indifferent businessman, the all-star outfit recorded relatively little during its peak (1927-1930).      With the departure of Redman in 1927, and the end of interim periods when Benny Carter and Horace Henderson wrote the bulk of the arrangements, Fletcher himself developed into a top arranger by the early ’30s. However, the Depression took its toll on the band, and the increased competition from other orchestras (along with some bad business decisions and the loss of Coleman Hawkins) resulted in Henderson breaking up the big band in early 1935",11361,blues,"['big band', 'dixieland', 'jazz piano', 'ragtime', 'stride', 'swing', 'tin pan alley', 'vintage jazz']",fletcher henderson,31,"['Sing You Sinners', 'Sugar Foot Stomp', 'Fidgety Feet', 'The Stampede', 'Blue Lou', ""He's the Hottest Man In Town"", 'Sugar Foot Stomp', 'King Porter Stomp', 'Hot And Anxious', 'Take Me Away From the River (Song of the Viper)']"
"Charley Patton (between April 1887 and 1891 – April 28, 1934), also known as [Charlie Patton](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Charlie+Patton), was an American Delta blues musician. He is considered by many to be the “Father of the Delta Blues”, and is credited with creating an enduring body of American music and personally inspiring just about every Delta blues man (Palmer, 1995). Musicologist Robert Palmer considers him among the most important musicians that America produced in the twentieth century. Many sources, including musical releases and his gravestone, spell his name “Charley” even though the musician himself spelled his name “Charlie”.      Patton was born in Hinds County, Mississippi, near the town of Edwards, and lived most of his life in Sunflower County in the Mississippi Delta. Some sources say he was born May 1, 1891, but there is some debate about this, and the years 1887 and 1894 have also been suggested.   Patton’s parentage and race have been the subject of debate. Although born to Bill and Annie Patton, locally he was regarded as having been fathered by former slave Henderson Chatmon, many of whose other children also became popular Delta musicians both as solo acts and as members of groups such as the Mississippi Sheiks. Biographer John Fahey describes Patton as having “light skin and Caucasian features.” Though Patton was considered African-American, because of his light complexion there have been rumors that he was Mexican, or possibly a full-blood Cherokee, a theory endorsed by Howlin’ Wolf. In actuality, Patton was a mix of white, black, and Cherokee (one of his grandmothers was a full-blooded Cherokee). Patton himself sang in “Down the Dirt Road Blues” of having gone to “the Nation” and “the Territo’”—meaning the Cherokee Nation portion of the Indian Territory (which became part of the state of Oklahoma in 1907), where a number of Black Indians tried unsuccessfully to claim a place on the tribal rolls and thereby obtain land.   In 1900, his family moved 100 miles (160 km) north to the legendary 10,000-acre (40 km2) Dockery Plantation sawmill and cotton farm near Ruleville, Mississippi. It was here that both John Lee Hooker and Howlin’ Wolf fell under the Patton spell as well as Willie Brown, Tommy Johnson, and Fiddlin’ Joe Martin. It was also here that Robert Johnson played and was given his first guitar. At Dockery, Charley fell under the tutelage of Henry Sloan, who had a new, unusual style of playing music which today would be considered very early blues. Charley followed Henry Sloan around, and, by the time he was about 19, had become an accomplished performer and songwriter in his own right, having already composed “Pony Blues,” a seminal song of the era.   Robert Palmer describes Patton as a “jack-of all-trades bluesman” who played “deep blues, white hillbilly songs, nineteenth-century ballads, and other varieties of black and white country dance music with equal facility”",3570425,blues,"['album rock', 'classic rock', 'folk', 'folk rock', 'folk-pop', 'mellow gold', 'rock', 'roots rock', 'singer-songwriter']",charley patton,76,"['High Water (For Charley Patton)', 'Down The Dirt Road Blues', 'Devil Sent The Rain Blues', 'A Spoonful Blues', 'High Water (For Charley Patton) - Live at Oakes Garden Theatre, Niagara Falls, ON - August 2003', 'Revenue Man Blues', ""Shake It And Break It (But Don't Let It Fall Mama)"", 'Charley Patton Songs', 'High Water (For Charley Patton)', ""You're Gonna Need Somebody When You Die""]"
"Invisible was originally formed by Luis Alberto Spinetta (guitars and vocals) who was formerly from the band Pescado Rabioso* that recently broke up at the time. The bass and drums were played by two former Pappo’s Blues members Hector Lorenzo (drums) and Carlos Rufino (bass.) During the beginning of the bands playing (1973) the music was more straightforward rock with influences of Hendrix and Zeppelin and touches of a Black Sabbath sound. Their first, self-titled album, reflected their influences and was very complex, especially for a three man rock group. Long songs, with surrealistic lyrics and a unique sound throughout the six tracks. This album is a top quality piece, of great beauty and suprisingly acute craftmanship.      Their next album “Durazno Sangrando” (“Bleeding Peach”) was their debut on a major label and an all out progressive album. Spinetta’s lyrics were very well written. The story to “Durazno Sangrando” was based on a book by Carl Jung. “Durazno Sangrando” is their most progressive album and is generally noted as the bands best material. In 1975, virtuoso guitarist Tommy Gubitsch joined the group. Their third and final album “El Jardín de los Presentes” (“The Garden of the Present”) turned out to be their most popular. This album has a lot of Tango influence and also some sounds that would remind us of early King Crimson. After the success of “El Jardín de los Presentes” the band split up at the end of 1976. Spinetta pursued a jazz-fusion esque solo career after the breakup.      Invisible was a bigger band in the Argentine prog scene and is definitely worth a good listen. If you are interested at all in Argentine prog they are essential. Their middle album “Durazno Sangrando” is their best and most interesting though “El Jardín de los Presentes” is also worth a good listen (mainly for it’s fusion of rock, prog, and tango influence.)      There is also a second Invisible:   Invisible is the artist name, William Orbit used when making a track called Scream. The track appeared on several albums, notably on the label Excession.

"Bobby Bare (born Robert Joseph Bare on April 7, 1935 in Ironton, Ohio) is an American country music singer and songwriter.      In the fifties after many failed attempts to sell his songs, he finally was signed up with Capitol Records and recorded a few rock and roll songs without much chart success. Just before he was drafted into the Army, he wrote a song called ‘The All American Boy’ and did a demo for his friend, [Bill Parsons](http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Parsons), to learn and record it. Instead of using the version Bill Parsons did later, the record company, Fraternity Records, decided to use the original demo done by Bobby Bare. The record reached number 2 on the Billboard Top 100, but it was wrongly credited to Bill Parsons.      His real big break came when RCA boss and guitarist Chet Atkins signed him to the RCA label. The first song he released on this label, ‘Shame On Me’, sold nearly a million copies and pushed Bobby Bare to fame overnight. His second RCA release, ‘Detroit City’ won him a Grammy for the best song of the year. Then a surge of hits followed, including ‘500 Miles Away From Home’, ‘Four Strong Winds’ and others. He has also recorded two very successful albums with [Skeeter Davis](http://www.last.fm/music/Skeeter+Davis) and has also dueted with [Lacy J. Dalton](http://www.last.fm/music/Lacy+J.+Dalton) and [Rosanne Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosanne+Cash) and additionally had a major hit as part of a trio with [Norma Jean](http://www.last.fm/music/Norma+Jean) (singer) and [Liz Anderson](http://www.last.fm/music/Liz+Anderson) in 1967 titled ‘The Game of Triangles’.      He moved to Mercury label in 1970 and had two big hits from early Kris Kristofferson compositions, ‘Come Sundown’ and ‘Please Don’t Tell Me How The Story Ends’ before returning to RCA label where he produced his own records. Later Bare moved to CBS label and in 1979, he helped establish Rosanne Cash’s career by singing with her on “No Memories Hangin’ Round”. Bare’s singles for Columbia Records included ‘The Jogger’, ‘Tequila Sheila’, ‘Gotta Get Rid Of This Band’, ‘When Hippies Get Older’ and ‘Numbers’. He later recorded for EMI with little success.      Bobby Bare is a versatile singer, and in the 70s started to release novelty songs recorded live with selected audiences. One of such songs, ‘Marie Laveau’ about a witch, reached the number one position on the country chart. This song was written by his friend, a very talented song writer, poet, author and cartoonist Shel Silverstein. He also penned many other songs for Bobby Bare including a Grammy nominated hit called ‘Daddy What If’ which he recorded with his five year old son, Bobby Bare Jr, who later became a star on his own. Bobby Bare later recorded a very successful album with his family and penned mainly by Shel called ‘Singing in The Kitchen’.

"Blind Willie Johnson (Willie Johnson, Brenham, Texas, January 22, 1897 – Beaumont, Texas, September 18, 1945) was an American singer and guitarist whose music straddled the border between blues and spirituals.      While the lyrics of all of his songs were religious, his music drew from both sacred and blues traditions. Among musicians, he is considered one of the greatest slide or bottleneck guitarists, as well as one of the most revered figures of depression-era gospel music. His music is distinguished by his powerful bass thumb-picking and gravelly false-bass voice, with occasional use of a tenor voice.      Blind Willie Johnson was born in 1897 near Brenham, Texas (before the discovery of his death certificate, Temple, Texas had been suggested as his birthplace). When he was five, he told his father he wanted to be a preacher, and then made himself a cigar box guitar. His mother died when he was young and his father remarried soon after her death.      Johnson was not born blind, and, although it is not known how he lost his sight, Angeline Johnson provided the following account to Samuel Charters. She said when Willie was seven his father beat his stepmother after catching her going out with another man. The stepmother then picked up a handful of lye and threw it, not at Willie’s father, but into the face of young Willie.      It is thought that Johnson was married twice, first to a woman with the same first name, Willie B Harris, and later to a young singer named Angeline, who was the sister of blues guitarist L.C. Robinson. No marriage certificates have yet been discovered. As Angeline Johnson often sang and performed with him, the first person to attempt to research his biography, Samuel Charters, made the mistake of assuming it was Angeline who had sung on several of Johnson’s records. However, later research showed that it was Johnson’s first wife.      Johnson remained poor until the end of his life, preaching and singing in the streets of Beaumont, Texas to anyone who would listen. A city directory shows that in 1944, a Rev W J Johnson, undoubtedly Blind Willie, operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, Beaumont, Texas. This is the same address listed on Blind Willie’s death certificate. In 1945, his home burned to the ground. With nowhere else to go, Johnson lived in the burned ruins of his home, sleeping on a wet bed. He lived like this until he contracted pneumonia two weeks later, and died. (The death certificate reports the cause of death as malarial fever, with syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.) In a later interview his wife said she tried to take him to a hospital but they refused to admit him because he was black, while other sources report that, according to Johnson’s wife, his refusal was due to his blindness. Although there is some dispute as to where his grave is, members of the Beaumont community have committed to finding the site and preserving it",58134,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'country blues', 'gospel blues', 'texas blues', 'traditional blues', 'traditional folk']",blind willie johnson,39,"['Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground', ""It's Nobody's Fault but Mine"", ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"", 'The Soul of a Man', 'Let Your Light Shine on Me', 'John the Revelator', 'Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed', ""Lord I Just Can't Keep From Crying"", ""If I Had My Way I'd Tear the Building Down"", 'John the Revelator']"
"Scott Joplin (born between June 1867 and January 1868, died April 1, 1917) was an American musician and composer of ragtime music. He remains the best-known ragtime figure and is regarded as one of the three most important composers of classic ragtime, along with James Scott and Joseph Lamb.      Scott Joplin, the second of six children, was born in eastern Texas, near Linden, to Florence Givins and Giles or Jiles Joplin. For many years, his birthdate was thought to be November 24, 1868; but research by ragtime historian Ed Berlin has revealed this is inaccurate.      After 1871, the Joplin family moved to Texarkana, Texas, and Scott’s mother cleaned homes so Scott could have a place to practice his music. By 1882 his mother had purchased a piano. Showing musical ability at an early age, the young Joplin received free piano lessons from a German music teacher, Julius Weiss, who gave him a well rounded knowledge of classical music form, which would serve him well in later years and fuel his ambition to create a “classical” form of ragtime. At the 1893 World’s Fair, in Chicago, Illinois, he heard the latest music, including the concert band of John Phillip Sousa, who played there daily. He would later further his musical education by attending George R. Smith College in Sedalia, Missouri, studying music theory, harmony, and composition.      By the late 1880s, Scott Joplin had left home to start a life of his own. He may have joined or formed various quartets and other musical groups and traveled around the Midwest to sing. In the Queen City Concert Band, he played first cornet. After organizing The Texas Medley Quartette, he helped them to sing their way to, and back from, Syracuse, New York. He was part of a minstrel troupe in Texarkana about 1891. In 1895, Joplin was in Syracuse, selling two songs, “Please Say You Will” and “A Picture of Her Face”.      Despite all his traveling, Joplin’s home was in Sedalia, to which he moved in 1894, working as a pianist in the Maple Leaf and the Black 400, social clubs for “respectable [black] gentlemen”.      By 1898 Joplin had sold six pieces for the piano. Of the six, only “Original Rags”, a compilation of existing melodies that he wrote collaboratively, is a ragtime piece. The other five were “Please Say You Will”, “A Picture of Her Face”, two marches, and a waltz.      In 1899, Joplin sold what would become one of his most famous pieces, “Maple Leaf Rag”, to John Stark & Son, a Sedalia music publisher. Joplin received a one-cent royalty for each copy and ten free copies for his own use, as well as an advance. It has been estimated that Joplin made $360 per year on this piece in his lifetime.      “Maple Leaf Rag” boosted Joplin to the top of the list of ragtime performers and moved ragtime into prominence as a musical form.      With a growing national reputation based on the success of “Maple Leaf Rag”, Joplin moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in early 1900 with his new wife, Belle",1067,classic,"['norwegian jazz', 'ragtime', 'stride']",scott joplin,36,"['The Entertainer', 'Maple Leaf Rag', 'Bethena: A Concert Waltz', 'Maple Leaf Rag', 'Stoptime Rag', 'The Ragtime Dance (arr.

"**Faith No More** is an [alternative metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20metal) group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&B, hip hop and jazz, among many others.      Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later [Faith No Man](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+Man). This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike “The Man” Morris. [Roddy Bottum](http://www.last.fm/music/Roddy+Bottum), [Mike Bordin](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Bordin), and [Billy Gould](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Gould) decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as “The Man” was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited [Jim Martin](http://www.last.fm/music/Jim+Martin). A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by [Courtney Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Courtney+Love). [Chuck Mosley](http://www.last.fm/music/Chuck+Mosley) became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably “[We Care a Lot](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/_/We+Care+a+Lot)”, which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as [Live Aid](http://www.last.fm/music/Live+Aid) and “We Are the World”.      The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of “creative differences.” In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band’s internal relationships had descended into “pathological hatred”. Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the “whipping boy” of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself.      Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer [Mike Patton](http://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Patton). Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band [Mr. Bungle](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Bungle) (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group’s first record with Patton, [The Real Thing](http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/The+Real+Thing), was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy.

"Alice DeeJay is a Dutch dance music group, who achieved success from 1999 to 2001. The group consists of producers Pronti (born Eelke Kalberg), Kalmani {born Sebastiaan Molijn) and DJ Jurgen, with lead singer Judith Pronk and accompanying singers Gaby and Jane. The group released their material on the Positiva label.      Alice Deejay launched their career in July 1999 with “Better Off Alone”, an accessible and upbeat Eurodance tune. In the UK, the song went platinum and reached number 2 in the UK singles chart. The group also achieved success with the follow-up single “Back In My Life” in November of the same year.      The group’s first and, to date, only album is Who Needs Guitars Anyway?, which was released on April 11, 2000. The album contains upbeat, popular dance tracks, and is one of only a handful of dance music albums to enter the Top Ten of the UK albums chart.      The group made the UK Top 20 with three more tracks: “Will I Ever”, “The Lonely One” and “Celebrate Our Love”, although each single’s chart position was lower than its predecessor’s one.      The group has not performed publicly since November 9, 2002, when they played seemingly their last gig in Utrecht.

"**DJ Spinna** (b. **[Vince Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Vince+Williams)**), is something of an anomaly in music. A humbling example of what it takes to truly succeed within the framework of multiple fields. A steadfast work ethic, an obsessively extensive vinyl library & the willingness to pursue - the full extent of his roots (funk, soul & jazz), foundation ([hip-hop](http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop)) & future (electronic / dance music) - without restraint.      A cornerstone of Hip-Hop’s late 90’s indie-uprise, DJ Spinna made much of his first impression on listeners as the musical background of his group [The Jigmastas](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Jigmastas) (having released an impressive slew of 12” singles on his then self-run label Beyond Real during this time) as well as providing the canvas for an array of that era’s lyrical giants. As an emcee in New York City, if you didn’t have a Spinna production under your belt, well, you just hadn’t accomplished all there was to accomplish. Everyone from [Mos Def](http://www.last.fm/music/Mos+Def), [Talib Kweli](http://www.last.fm/music/Talib+Kweli) to [Pharaohe Monch](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pharaohe+Monch) boasted Spinna beats to prove their worth to the scene. At the height of indie-kingpin [rawkus records](http://www.last.fm/label/rawkus+records) heyday, Spinna was in demand, also churning out timeless classics of the era from the likes of [J-Live](http://www.last.fm/music/J-Live), [Mr. Complex](http://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Complex) and [The Polyrhythm Addicts](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Polyrhythm+Addicts) (his all-too-brief collabo-group with Apani B., Shaabam Sadeeq and Complex).      As collaborative production work flooded his studio, from hip-hop legends like [Sadat X](http://www.last.fm/music/Sadat+X) & [Grand Puba](http://www.last.fm/music/Grand+Puba) ([Brand Nubian](http://www.last.fm/music/Brand+Nubian)), [Masta Ace](http://www.last.fm/music/Masta+Ace) and [Guru](http://www.last.fm/music/Guru) ([Gangstarr](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Gangstarr)) to even [The Jungle Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Jungle+Brothers). Yet, while his stock as a the go-to producer rose so did his value as a key, if not crucial, remixer.

His fourth album, _[Duotones](http://www.last.fm/music/Kenny+G/Duotones)_, brought him breakthrough success in 1986. Kenny G’s main instrument is the soprano saxophone, but he also on occasion plays alto and tenor saxophone. He started playing the saxophone when he was 10 years old, in 1966.      **Kenny G** has long been the musician many [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) listeners love to hate.

"The members of Orgy — Jay Gordon (vocals), Amir Derakh (guitar-synths), Ryan Shuck (guitar), Paige Haley (bass), and Bobby Hewitt (drums) — have described their music as “Death Pop” in the past, but few agree on what to call their blend of rock, metal and electronica.      The band was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1997 and signed to [Korn](http://www.last.fm/music/Korn)’s Elementree record label soon after. They quickly released their first album, “Candyass.” Soon after, they performed the duty of opening act on the Family Values tour in ‘98, where they were introduced to many for the first time. Around then, they had their first hit with a cover of [New Order](http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order)’s [Blue Monday](http://www.last.fm/music/New+Order/_/Blue+Monday), followed with successful singles for [Stitches](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgy/_/Stitches) and [Fiction (Dreams In Digital)](http://www.last.fm/music/Orgy/_/Fiction+\(Dreams+In+Digital\)). After the release of their second album, “Vapor Transmission”, they left Elementree records, and largely disappeared from the public eye.      Bobby briefly joined [Snake River Conspiracy](http://www.last.fm/music/Snake+River+Conspiracy) for a while, and Jay formed his own independent record label, D1 Music, with his father. In 2004, Orgy’s third album, “Punk Statik Paranoia,” was released under D1, but with little to no radio play or recognition from the mainstream music media.      Ryan and Amir have also started a side project known as [Julien-K](http://www.last.fm/music/Julien-K), with a much more electronic focus, and have released a song featuring the vocals of [Chester Bennington](http://www.last.fm/music/Chester+Bennington) of [Linkin Park](http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park) on the recent Underworld Evolution soundtrack. They have since formed the project Dead By Sunrise with Bennington. Amir Derakh was immortalised in the [Coal Chamber](http://www.last.fm/music/Coal+Chamber) song [Amir Of The Desert](http://www.last.fm/music/Coal+Chamber/_/Amir+Of+The+Desert). He produced their debut album. Jay Gordon appeared on the follow up “Chamber Music”.      When asked for an Orgy update in late July 2008, Shuck informed fans that Orgy’s return is still underway but their priority is getting the much delayed Julien-K album released. During a video interview at the annual Californian NAMM 2009 convention, Derakh mentioned a 2010 Orgy reunion.      On March 30, 2010, through a video to his Julien-K, Dead By Sunrise, and Orgy followers, Shuck informed that there are plans for a tour in 2010. On October 25, 2010, Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh informed on the Julien-K blog that “As of Oct. 26th we will no longer be part of Orgy. Jay will continue making music without the original members.

"Kenneth Donald Rogers (born August 21, 1938, in Houston, Texas) is a prolific American country music singer, photographer, producer, songwriter, actor and businessman. Kenny Rogers graduated from Jefferson Davis High School in Houston.      Although he has been very successful, charting more than 60 top 40 hit singles across various music genres and topping the country and pop album charts for more than 100 individual weeks in the United States alone, many still consider him a vastly underrated artist. To his fans, he is extraordinarily popular; women in concert audiences bring him roses in unrelenting waves throughout a performance. He appeals to all age groups and still sells millions of albums.      Both his albums “The Gambler” and “Kenny” are featured in the About.com poll of “The 200 Most Influential Country Albums Ever”.[1] He has also been voted the “Favorite Singer of All-Time”, in a 1986 joint poll by readers of both USA Today and People.      He has received hundreds of awards for both his music and charity work. These include AMA’s Grammy’s, ACM’s and CMA’s, as well as a lifetime achievement award for a career spanning six decades in 2003      Most recently, Rogers hit with his new album release, “Water & Bridges”, an across the board hit, that peaked at #5 in the Billboard Country Albums sales charts, also charting high in the Billboard 200. The first single from the album, “I Can’t Unlove You,” is also a hit. He is currently planning a tour of the United Kingdom, in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 interview he told DJ Steve Wright, his favorite hit of his was The Gambler.      Biography      Brief Overview   His career began in the mid-1950s, when he recorded with a doo-wop group called The Scholars. Their break up was followed by a minor solo hit called “That Crazy Feeling” (1958). After sales slowed down, Kenneth Rogers (as he was billed then) joined a Jazz group called The Bobby Doyle Trio. Disbanded in 1965, a 1966 jazzy rock single for Mercury called “Here’s That Rainy Day” failed. In 1966 he joined the New Christy Minstrels. He left with fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams and Thelma Camacho. They formed The First Edition in 1967 (later renamed “Kenny Rogers and The First Edition”). They chalked up a string of hits on both the pop and country charts, including “Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love To Town”, “Reuben James” and “Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In).” In his First Edition days Rogers had long brown hair, an earring, and pink sunglasses. Known affectionately in retrospect as “Hippie Kenny”, Rogers had a much smoother vocal style at the time.

"Bix Beiderbecke (March 10, 1903 – August 6, 1931) was a notable jazz cornet player.      It was widely believed, for many years, that Beiderbecke’s real name was Leon Bismark Beiderbecke. It is now known that this — like so many other myths about Beiderbecke — is untrue. His real name was Leon Bix Beiderbecke. Bismark was a family name, reflecting the family’s German origins, but it was not given to Beiderbecke. “Bix” was a family nickname of his father and older brother, given him as a proper name.   Leon Bix Beiderbecke was born in Davenport, Iowa to a middle-class family. As a teenager he would sneak off to the banks of the Mississippi to listen to the bands play on the riverboats that would come up from the south.      Partially due to frequent absences due to illness, Beiderbecke’s grades suffered. His parents felt that sending him to the exclusive Lake Forest Academy in Lake Forest, Illinois, just northwest of Chicago, would provide the attention and discipline needed to improve his schooling.      Beiderbecke’s schooling there soon suffered when the only subjects he showed avid interest in were music and sports. Bix soon began going into Chicago as often as possible to catch the hot jazz bands of the day at clubs and speakeasies around Chicago, and too often didn’t return in time or was found out the next day.      Beiderbecke was soon asked to leave the Academy due to his academic failings and extra-curricular activities in Chicago, and began his musical career in earnest.      Beiderbecke first recorded with his band the Wolverine Orchestra (usually called just The Wolverines, named for “Wolverine Blues” by Jelly Roll Morton because they played it so often) in 1924, then became a sought-after musician in Chicago, Illinois and New York City, New York. He made innovative and influential recordings with Frankie Trumbauer (“Tram”) and the Jean Goldkette Orchestra. When the Goldkette Orchestra disbanded after their last recording (“In My Merry Oldsmobile”), in May 1927, Bix and Trumbauer, a ‘C’ Melody and alto saxophone player, briefly joined Adrian Rollini’s band at the Club New Yorker, New York, before moving on to the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, the most popular and highest paid band of the day.      Beiderbecke suffered health problems from an early age, though the relentless schedule of the road and heavy drinking leading to alcoholism began to contribute to and exacerbate a decline in his health. Bix suffered from severe pain in his legs and other ill effects of prohibition era alcohol and with declining work around the New York City area, he took a turn for the worse.      Though his death certificate described the cause of death as pneumonia, and he was in seriously ill health, the circumstances immediately surrounding his death are still unclear. He died at the age of 28, in his apartment at 43-30 46th Street, Sunnyside, Queens, within the confines of the City of New York on August 6, 1931.

"**Freddy Fender** (born Baldemar Garza Huerta in San Benito, Texas, USA on 4 June 1937 – 14 October 2006) was a Mexican-American [tejano](http://www.last.fm/tag/tejano), country and rock and roll musician, known for his work as a solo artist and in the groups [Los Super Seven](http://www.last.fm/music/Los+Super+Seven) and the [Texas Tornados](http://www.last.fm/music/Texas+Tornados). He is best known for his 1975 hits “Before the Next Teardrop Falls” and the subsequent remake of his own “Wasted Days and Wasted Nights”.      In 1959, Fender recorded the blues ballad “Wasted Days and Wasted Nights.” The song became popular in 1959, but he was beset by legal troubles after he and a band member were arrested for possession of marijuana. After a two years in Louisiana’s Angola prison farm, he was released through the intercession of Gov. Jimmie Davis, also a songwriter and musician. Davis requested that Fender stay away from music while on probation as a condition of his release. By the end of the 1960s, Fender was back in Texas working as a mechanic, and attending a local junior college, while only playing music on the weekends.      Number One Pop and Country   In 1974, Fender recorded “Before The Next Teardrop Falls.” The single was selected for national distribution, and became a number one hit on the Billboard Country and Pop charts. His next four singles, including a remake of “Wasted Days”, all hit the number one spot on the Billboard Country charts. During the next few years, Fender had several major country hits, including the No. 1 hits “Secret Love” (1975) and “You’ll Lose a Good Thing” (1976).      Texas Tornados   In the 1990s, Fender teamed up with fellow Tex-Mex musicians Doug Sahm, Flaco Jimenez and Augie Myers to form the Tex-Mex supergroup the Texas Tornados, whose work was widely acclaimed. Following the death of Sahm, the production of the Tornadoes slowed.      Los Super Seven   Freddy Fender continued to still be on top with a groundbreaking collaboration with several musical legends to produce another supergroup, Los Super Seven which consisted of David Hidalgo (vocals, guitar, drums, bass, percussion, requinto, hidalguera); Rick Trevino, Joe Ely (vocals, guitar); Flaco Jimenez (vocals, accordion); Cesar Rosas (vocals, six-string bass, guitar, guitarron, jarana); Freddy Fender (vocals, acoustic bass); Ruben Ramos (vocals). This Super Seven effort won a Grammy in 1999.   On February 4, 1999, Freddy’s star was installed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.   In 2004, the Texas Folklife Resources produced a widely acclaimed sell-out show at the Paramount in Austin, Texas ” Fifty Years of Freddy Fender”, where Freddy was honored and then performed to a packed house. Also in 2004, Freddy’s hometown of San Benito Texas honored Freddy with his likeness emblazoned on their new watertower with “Hometown of Freddy Fender”.

"John Adam Estes (born in Ripley, Lauderdale County, Tennessee, January 25, 1899 — Brownsville, Haywood County, Tennessee, June 5, 1977) best known as Sleepy John Estes or Sleepy John, was a [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) guitarist, songwriter and vocalist.      In 1915, Estes’ father, a sharecropper who also played some guitar, moved the family to Brownsville, Tennessee. Not long after, Estes lost the sight of his right eye when a friend threw a rock at him during a baseball game. At the age of 19, while working as a field hand, he began to perform professionally. The venues were mostly local parties and picnics, with the accompaniment of Hammie Nixon, a harmonica player, and James “Yank” Rachell, a guitarist and mandolin player. He would continue to work on and off with both musicians for more than fifty years.   Estes made his debut as a recording artist in Memphis, Tennessee in 1929, at a session organized by Ralph Peer for Victor Records. His partnership with Nixon was first documented on songs such as “Drop Down Mama” and “Someday Baby Blues” in 1935; later sides replaced the harmonica player with the guitarists Son Bonds or Charlie Pickett. He later recorded for the Decca and Bluebird labels, with his last pre-war recording session taking place in 1941. He made a brief return to recording at Sun Studio in Memphis in 1952, recording “Runnin’ Around” and “Rats in My Kitchen”, but otherwise was largely out of the public eye for two decades.   Estes was a fine singer, with a distinctive “crying” vocal style. He frequently teamed with more capable musicians, like “Yank” Rachell, Hammie Nixon, and the piano player Jab Jones. Estes sounded so much like an old man, even on his early records, that blues revivalists reportedly delayed looking for him because they assumed he would have to be long dead, and because fellow musician Big Bill Broonzy had written that Estes had died. By the time he was tracked down, by Bob Koester and Samuel Charters in 1962, he had become completely blind and was living in poverty. He resumed touring and recording, reunited with Nixon and toured Europe several times and Japan, with a clutch of albums released on the Delmark Records label. His later records are generally considered less interesting than his pre-war output. Nevertheless, Estes, Nixon and Rachell also made a successful appearance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival.   Bob Dylan mentions Estes in the sleevenotes to Bringing It All Back Home (1965).   Many of Estes’ original songs were based on events in his own life or on people he knew from his home town of Brownsville, Tennessee, such as the local lawyer (“Lawyer Clark Blues”), local auto mechanic (“Vassie Williams’ Blues”), or an amorously inclined teenage girl (“Little Laura Blues”). “Lawyer Clark Blues” referenced the lawyer, and later judge and senator, Hugh L.

"Erik Schrody (born August 18, 1969 in Valley Stream, New York), better known by his stage name [Everlast](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast), is a Grammy- Award winning Irish-American rapper and [singer- songwriter](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer-songwriter), known for his solo hit “[What It’s Like](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast/_/What+It%27s+Like)” and as being the front-man for rap group [House of Pain](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain).      He was also a part of the hip-hop supergroup [La Coka Nostra](http://www.last.fm/music/La+Coka+Nostra), which consists of his former House of Pain mates, [Danny Boy](http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Boy) and [DJ Lethal](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Lethal) along with underground rap veteran [Ill Bill](http://www.last.fm/music/Ill+Bill) and Irish-American rapper [Slaine](http://www.last.fm/music/Slaine). On July 14, 2009, they released their debut album, ‘[A Brand You Can Trust](http://www.last.fm/music/La+Coka+Nostra/A+Brand+You+Can+Trust)’, through Uncle Howie Records and Suburban Noize Records.      Everlast was born in Valley Stream, New York of Irish descent. His grandfather was of German descent. Emerging as a member of the [Rhyme Syndicate](http://www.last.fm/music/Rhyme+Syndicate), Everlast’s first solo album [Forever Everlasting](http://www.last.fm/music/Everlast/Forever+Everlasting) (1990), largely made possible by MC [Ice T](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ice+T), was a disappointment both critically and commercially. Following the album’s failure, Everlast teamed up with DJ Lethal and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain. The group was signed to [Tommy Boy](http://www.last.fm/label/Tommy+Boy) Records, and their eponymous debut album, [House of Pain](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/House+of+Pain) (1992), went multi-platinum, spawning the successful [DJ Muggs](http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Muggs) produced single [Jump Around](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Jump+Around). This song was also remixed twice by [Pete Rock](http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Rock), one version featuring a verse from him and one without. The album also featured [Cypress Hill](http://www.last.fm/music/Cypress+Hill) member, [B-Real](http://www.last.fm/music/B-Real), on the song [Put Your Head Out](http://www.last.fm/music/House+of+Pain/_/Put+Your+Head+Out).      Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with [Helmet](http://www.last.fm/music/Helmet), along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative [Judgment Night](http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Judgment+Night) movie soundtrack.

"**Duran Duran** (named after a character in Roger Vadim’s sci-fi classic, Barbarella) is an [electronic](http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic) [pop rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop%20rock) band that was part of the [new wave](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20wave) movement of the [80s](http://www.last.fm/tag/80s) and [90s](http://www.last.fm/tag/90s). Created by [Nick Rhodes](http://www.last.fm/music/Nick+Rhodes) (keyboards) and [John Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/John+Taylor) (bass) in Birmingham, England in 1978, it later add took in [Roger Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Taylor) (drums), [Andy Taylor](http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Taylor) (guitar), and [Simon Le Bon](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Le+Bon) (lead vocals). The band has sold more than 70 million records over their more than 25 years of existence, making them one of the best-selling groups in history.      Their songs are often [vivid](http://www.last.fm/tag/vivid), hook-laden pieces [dance pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/dance%20pop) that have fared well on the radio, but what many remember best about Duran Duran is their iconic music videos. Though many of the videos were tongue-in-cheek, the band has never quite escaped the glamorous and decadent ‘jet set’ image that their early videos projected. Their flashy outfits and strident, [art rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/art%20rock) influenced music showed an immense debt to [70s](http://www.last.fm/tag/70s) English [glam](http://www.last.fm/tag/glam) artists such as [David Bowie](http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie) and [Roxy Music](http://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music), yet the band grasped a sense of their own identity and became one of the keystones of the [new romantic](http://www.last.fm/tag/new%20romantic) movement.      Their first singer and one of their original founding members was [Stephen Duffy](http://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Duffy), and their original bassist was [Simon Colley](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Colley). Several drummers and guitarists were subsequently tried, as well as a handful of vocalists, after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979. The band felt that they had something special with vocalist [Simon Le Bon](http://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Le+Bon), and the group smashed into the [pop](http://www.last.fm/tag/pop) scene shortly afterwards when “[Planet Earth](http://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran/_/Planet+Earth)”, their debut single, was released on 2 February 1981.      “[Planet Earth](http://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran/_/Planet+Earth)” became an immediate hit in the band’s native U.K., reaching #12 on the U.K. Singles Chart on 21 February, and it did even better in Australia, hitting #8 there. Being Duran Duran’s first Top 10 hit anywhere in the world, the song showed the group’s interest in international stardom. The band’s eponymous debut album came out promptly afterwards in June 1981. ‘_[Duran Duran](http://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran/Duran+Duran)_’ hit #3 on the album charts and remained in the U",1288512,classic,"['dance rock', 'new romantic', 'new wave', 'new wave pop', 'rock', 'soft rock', 'synthpop']",duran duran,70,"['Hungry Like the Wolf - 2009 Remaster', 'Ordinary World', 'Come Undone', 'Rio - 2009 Remaster', 'Girls on Film - 2010 Remaster', 'Of Crime and Passion', 'The Reflex', 'Hungry Like the Wolf', 'The Reflex - Single Version;2010 Remastered Version', 'Hungry Like the Wolf']"
"There are four bands with the name Toy Box: (1) a Danish pop group, Toy-Box, formed in the 1990s; (2) a post-grunge alternative metal band, Toy Box, from Ontario formed in 2004; (3) a UK glam-rock band, Toybox, based in Northampton and Brighton; (4) a US rock band based in Tempe, Arizona.      (1) **Toy-Box** (<http://www.toy-box.dk.tp>) is a Danish pop group formed in the 1990s. It consists of two members, both vocalists: [Anila Mirza](http://www.last.fm/music/Anila+Mirza) and Amir El-Falaki. Anila was born October 8, 1974 in Hillerød, Denmark to a half-Pakistani, half-Persian mother, and an Indian father. Amir was born August 12, 1973 in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1999, they had some success in the Scandinavian music charts with a bubblegum pop song from their album Fantastic, named “Tarzan & Jane”. Toy- Box’s first album, _Fantastic_, included the hits “The Sailor Song”, “Best Friend”, “Super-Duper-Man”, “Teddy-Bear” and “Tarzan & Jane”. It was released in September 1999 and followed in 2001 by a second album, Toyride, which included fan-favorite songs “Www.girl”, “Prince of Arabia” and “Wizard of Oz”. The group has broken up. Amir is working as a dance teacher, music video choreographer and trainer to F.C. Copenhagen’s cheerleading team. Anila changed her name to Aneela and began a solo career.      (2) **Toy Box** (<http://www.myspace.com/toyboxmusic>) is a post-grunge alternative metal band from Ontario, Canada, formed in 2004 by Deriek Simon (lead vocals, guitars), Carmine Mallia (drums, percussion), and Duncan McIlroy (bass, vocals). After touring across Canada in 2004—including performances at Edgefest, sharing stages with Finger Eleven, Thornley, Idle Sons, Scratching Post, Swollen Members, Rascals, and Clarknova—Toy Box rolled into the Voodoo Records studios, Canada’s hottest independent label, to create a full length album. Their onstage energy is immediately addictive to anyone who has had the opportunity to catch a live performance. Likewise, this energy and massive sound has been captured in their debut album _The Assasination Of…_ released in the fall of 2007. Beautifully crafted, poetic lyrics, razor sharp guitar riffs, groovy bass lines, beefy drum beats that would make John Bonham proud. This has been contrasted with string and piano arrangements delicately placed throughout to form a dramatic backdrop for vocals so powerful and intense your brain begs for more.      (3) **Toybox** (<http://www.myspace.com/toyboxband>) is also a UK glam-rock band, based in Northampton and Brighton, consisting of Alice Acidosis, Cinderella Swallows, Roberta Rim Job, and Nurse KKK.      (4) **Toybox** (<http://www.myspace.com/toybx>) is a US rock band based in Tempe, Arizona, consisting of Yohei (Vocals, Bass), Naoto (Guitar, Vocals), and Celica (Drums). To date, they have released one EP called “Five Seconds To…” and a full length album titled “Stay Alive”. Both can be found on iTunes.

"Breakbeat and musicality aren’t always easy bedfellows. Some noisecore terrorists shun the sounds of any real instruments, but the productions of Ils have always managed to combine melody and harmony with astute dancefloor savvy. Whether it be some of the jazzy drum + bass tracks he released on LTJ Bukem’s label in the mid-90s or the amazing ‘Next Level’ - one of the biggest breakbeat tracks ever - Ils has quite a pedigree of tracks.      His third artist album, ‘Bohemia’, carries on his tradition of exploring assorted flavours in breakbeat science. Spiritual, rocky, decadent and moving - the byword throughout is quality. Ils has already started the process of having some of the tracks remixed for singles, but as a body of work the album stands up as something a bit special.      “The working title for ‘Bohemia’ was ‘Masterpiece’,” Ils explains, “which I obviously wasn’t going to call it in the end, but I had that name written on post-it notes all around the studio. It kind of raises the bar in terms of quality, it’s just a way of psychologically upping your own standards. The working title of my last album ‘Soul Trader’ was ‘Green Fields’, just because I had my studio out in the countryside and I wanted it to be less of an urban thing and more just good music that would work out in open greenery - as well as in a club environment.” Ils initially did a dummy run of this album with just one singer - Val from London indie band the Bee Stings. He then brought in other vocalists - Bulgarian duo Desi and Roni, growling grime/garage MC Wonder (on the Prodigy-esque ‘Feel My Addiction’), Plavka who sang on Jam + Spoon’s hit ‘Right In The Night’ a decade ago, R+B singer Rhalia - to weave his production magic around and flesh out the meat on the bones. One track even includes snatches of his late friend Stevie Hyper D, the junglist MC who passed away a few years back. The resulting kick-ass breaks track ‘The World Is Yours’ is a fitting tribute to the drum + bass hero.      There’s a tale behind all the vocalists and the elements they bring to the melting pot, but the story of the Bulgarian singers is perhaps the most, err, bohemian. Deeply into spiritualism, the two spend a lot of time looking after a renowned 98-year-old shamanistic woman who lives up a mountain. “These two are deeply into spiritualism and I wanted that kind of influence brought in to give the album an extra dimension,” Ils outlines. “I’ve been DJing in eastern Europe quite a lot in the past couple of years, in Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Rumania. One of these women singers helps arrange a lot of the club- nights, or parties on the beach. I’ve used their voices like another instrument on a few tracks.”      As well as the ethereal Bulgarian voices, war is another thread that runs throughout ‘Bohemia’. “I was really upset by the Iraq war and the media images around it,” says Ils. “There was tens of thousands of innocent deaths - I was shocked and horrified",419390,world,['chanson'],ils,64,"['Comme ils disent', 'Feed The Addiction', ""Baba O'Riley - Ils Club Mix"", 'Ils appellent ça', 'Ils sont cools', 'Jeux, L. 126: Ils dansent ensemble', 'Ils nous comprennent pas', 'Ils parlent de moi', ""Ils m'auront pas"", ""J'ai encore rêvé d'elle""]"
"By most accounts, **George Jones** (born George Glenn Jones September 12, 1931 in Saratoga, Texas, died April 26, 2013, in Nashville, Tennessee), was the finest [vocalist](http://www.last.fm/tag/vocalist) in the recorded history of [country](http://www.last.fm/tag/country) music. Initially, he was a hardcore [honky tonk](http://www.last.fm/tag/honky%20tonk)er in the tradition of [Hank Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Hank+Williams), but over the course of his career he developed an affecting, nuanced ballad style. In the course of his career, he never left the top of the country charts, even as he suffered innumerable personal and professional difficulties. Only [Eddy Arnold](http://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+Arnold) had more Top Ten hits, and Jones always stayed closer to the roots of hardcore country.      Jones was born and raised in east Texas, near the city of Beaumont. At an early age, he displayed an affection for music. He enjoyed the gospel he heard in church and on the family’s [Carter Family](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Carter+Family) records, but he truly became fascinated with country music when his family bought a radio when he was seven. When he was nine, his father bought him his first guitar. Soon, his father had Jones playing and singing on the streets on Beaumont, earning spare change. At 16, he ran away to Jasper, TX, where he sang at a local radio station. Jones married Dorothy, his first wife, in 1950 when he was 19 years old. The marriage collapsed within a year and he enlisted in the Marines at the end of 1951. Though the U.S. was at war with Korea, Jones never served overseas — he was stationed at a military camp in California, where he kept singing in bars. After he was discharged, Jones immediately began performing again.      In 1953, Jones was discovered by record producer Pappy Daily, who was also the co-owner of Starday Records, a local Texas label. Impressed with Jones’ potential, Daily signed the singer to Starday. “[No Money In This Deal](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Jones/_/No+Money+In+This+Deal),” Jones’ first single, was released in early 1954, but it received no attention. Starday released three more singles that year, which all were ignored. Jones released “[Why, Baby, Why](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Jones/_/Why,+Baby,+Why)” late in the summer of 1955 and the single became his first hit, peaking at number four. However, its momentum was halted by a cover version by [Webb Pierce](http://www.last.fm/music/Webb+Pierce) and [Red Sovine](http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Sovine) that hit number one on the country charts.      Jones was on the road to success and Daily secured the singer a spot on the Louisiana Hayride, where he co-billed with [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley). Jones reached the Top Ten with regularity in 1956 with such singles as “[What Am I Worth](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Jones/_/What+Am+I+Worth)” and “[Just One More](http://www.last",324039,country,"['alternative metal', 'contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'modern country rock', 'post-grunge', 'redneck']",george jones,62,"['Country Boy (feat.

"Duke Ellington (Edward Kennedy Ellington, April 29, 1899 - May 24, 1974) was an American jazz composer, pianist and bandleader, one of the most influential figures in jazz, if not in all American music.   Duke Ellington composed over 3000 songs, including: “It Don’t Mean A Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing”, “Sophisticated Lady”, “Mood Indigo”, “Solitude”, “In a Mellotone”, and “Satin Doll”.   Through the ranks of [Duke Ellington & His Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington+&+His+Orchestra) passed some of the biggest names in jazz, including [Billy Strayhorn](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Strayhorn), [Johnny Hodges](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Hodges), [Cootie Williams](http://www.last.fm/music/Cootie+Williams), [Bubber Miley](http://www.last.fm/music/Bubber+Miley), [Barney Bigard](http://www.last.fm/music/Barney+Bigard), [Ben Webster](http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Webster), [Harry Carney](http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Carney), [Sonny Greer](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Greer), [Otto Hardwick](http://www.last.fm/music/Otto+Hardwick), [Clark Terry](http://www.last.fm/music/Clark+Terry), [Jimmy Blanton](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Blanton), [Ray Nance](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Nance), [Paul Gonsalves](http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Gonsalves), and [Wellman Braud](http://www.last.fm/music/Wellman+Braud). Many musicians stayed with him for decades. And while all of them were remarkable in their own right, and they all would have probably made it into the annals of jazz history no matter who they played for, it was Ellington’s genius as a composer, pianist, bandleader, celebrity personality, and, most importantly, arranger, that made them the most incredible orchestral unit in the history of jazz. His ability to write and arrange for personalities, rather than instruments, made every solo and every section of every arrangement breathe with character. A giant on the 20th century American cultural scene, Duke Ellington was widely regarded as a legend during his own lifetime.      Early life      Edward Kennedy Ellington was born on April 29, 1899 to James Edward Ellington and Daisy Kennedy Ellington. They lived with his maternal grandparents at 2129 Ward Place, NW in Washington, D.C., USA.   James Edward Ellington was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina on April 15, 1879 and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1886 with his parents. Daisy Kennedy, was born in Washington, D.C. on January 4, 1879, and was the daughter of a former American slave. J.E. made blueprints for the United States Navy. He also worked as a butler for Dr. Middleton F. Cuthbert, a prominent white physician, and occasionally worked as a White House caterer. Daisy and J.E. were both piano players—she playing parlor songs and he operatic airs.      At the age of seven, Ellington began taking piano lessons from Mrs. Marietta Clinkscales.

He was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on October 24, 1911, and died on March 11, 1986 in Mineola, New York. He was most widely known for his energetic [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) [harmonica](http://www.last.fm/tag/harmonica) style which frequently included vocal whoops and hollers, and imitations of trains and fox hunts.      His father, a farmer, taught him to play basic blues harp as a youth. He sustained injuries to his eyes at a young age which eventually prevented him from doing farm work himself. In order to earn a living Sonny was now forced to play music. He began playing in Shelby, North Carolina. After his father died he began playing with Piedmont-style guitarist Blind Boy Fuller. When Fuller died, he established a long-standing musical relationship with [Brownie McGhee](http://www.last.fm/music/Brownie+McGhee), and the pair recorded numerous tracks together. The duo became well-known, even among white audiences, as they joined the growing folk movement of the 1950s and ’60s.

"New Orleans-based rapper Juvenile was born Terius Gray. After beginning his performing career while in his teens, he released a 1995 album on Warlock titled Being Myself. He eventually crossed paths with Cash Money label owners Ronald “Suga Slim” and Brian “Baby” Williams, who issued 1996’s Solja Rags; the album became a major underground hit, and set the stage for the release of 1998’s 400 Degreez. In 1999, with Juvenile’s popularity growing, Solja Rags was reissued nationally, and Warlock jumped on the bandwagon with a remixed version of Being Myself. The year ended with the release of a new studio effort, Tha G-Code, followed by Project English two years later in 2001. In 2002 he left Cash Money and formed his own collective, the UTP Playas (Uptown Project Playas), with whom he recorded a posse album, The Compilation. The album went nowhere and a year later he was back on Cash Money and releasing Juve the Great which featured the chart-topping hit “Slow Motion”.

"Def Leppard are an English [hard rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20rock) / [heavy metal](http://www.last.fm/tag/heavy%20metal) band from Sheffield, who formed in 1977 during the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Largely on the strength of their albums Pyromania and Hysteria, Def Leppard became one of the top-selling rock bands throughout the 1980s, selling over 65 million albums worldwide, including over 35 million in the United States alone.      Rick Savage (bass), Pete Willis (guitar), and Tony Kenning (drums), all students at Tapton School in Sheffield, formed a band called Atomic Mass in 1977. Following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus, 18-year old Joe Elliott tried out for the band as a guitarist. During his audition, however, it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer.      Soon afterward they adopted a name proposed by Elliott, “Deaf Leopard”, which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class. At Kenning’s suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band. In January of 1978, Steve Clark joined the band. According to Joe Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Freebird” in its entirety.      In November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as the Def Leppard EP, Kenning abruptly left the band. He was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. By the end of the month Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer.      Sales of the EP soared after the track “Getcha Rocks Off” was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.      Throughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock/heavy metal fans and were even initially considered the leaders of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (a status eventually claimed by Iron Maiden). Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US).      Def Leppard’s debut album, On Through the Night, was released on March 14, 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences[citation needed] by recording songs like “Hello America” and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent).

"Woodrow Charles Herman (May 16, 1913 – October 29, 1987), better known as Woody Herman, was an American jazz clarinetist, alto and soprano saxophonist, singer, and Big band leader. During his lifetime, he led some of the most exciting big bands of the twentieth century. His bands changed styles and approaches to jazz but still managed to keep their musical integrity.      Herman was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a child he worked as a singer in vaudeville, then became a professional saxophone player at age 15. When Isham Jones’s band, of which Herman had been a member, broke up in 1936, he formed his own band, the Woody Herman Orchestra, with some of his band mates. This band became known for its orchestrations of the blues and was sometimes billed as “The Band That Plays The Blues”.      On April 12, 1939 Woody Herman recorded his greatest commercial and mega popular hit record “Woodchoppers’ Ball”, featuring Woody on clarinet, Neal Ried on trombone, Saxie Mansfield on Sax, Steady Nelson on trumpet and Hy White on guitar. Other big early hits were “Blue Flame,” “Dupree Blues”, “Blues Upstairs and Downstairs” and “Blues in the Night” with Joe Bishop on flugelhorn, Tommy Linehans on piano, Cappy Lewis on trumpet, and the strong rhythm team of Walt Yoder and Frankie Carlson.      This popular swing band took off and was listed number three in the country in a popularity poll by Down Beat Magazine in 1940. This band recorded for the Decca label. The band was first pinned “Herman’s Herd” in a Martin band instrument advertisement in the same magazine on April 1, 1941.      This band’s music was heavily influenced by Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Its lively, swinging arrangements, combining bop themes with swing rhythm parts, were greatly admired; Igor Stravinsky wrote “Ebony Concerto” for this band. Other pieces for which the band was known include “Caldonia” and “Northwest Passage.” During this time, Woody Herman recorded for the Columbia label. Featured musicians were trumpeter Sonny Berman,trumpeter/arranger Neil Hefti, trumpeter/vocalist Steady Nelson, tenor saxist Flip Phillips, trombonist Bill Harris, vibraphonist Red Norvo, pianist/arranger Ralph Burns, drummers Davey Tough and Don Lamond and bassist Chubby Jackson, who was the driving force/talent scout behind the bands progressive development.      Herman was forced to disband the orchestra in 1946 at the height of its success, his only financially successful band, to spend more time with his wife and family. During this time, he and his family had just moved into the former Hollywood home of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Another reason Herman may have disbanded was his wife Charlotte’s growing problems with alcoholism and pill addiction. In 1947 Herman organized the Second Herd and in 1948 moved to the Capitol label",13853,blues,"['big band', 'cool jazz', 'stride', 'swing']",woody herman,33,"[""Woodchopper's Ball"", 'Blues In The Night', 'Four Brothers', 'Caldonia', 'Laura - 78rpm Version', 'Woodchoppers Ball', 'Jazz Me Blues', 'La Fiesta', 'Early Autumn', 'Dark Eyes / It Happened In Monterey - Remastered']"
"**B. B. King** (b. September 16, 1925 in Itta Bena, Mississippi) is a U.S. [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) guitarist and songwriter. He is among the most respected electric guitarists; Rolling Stone magazine ranked him third in its list of the hundred greatest guitarists of all time.      Born as Riley B. King, he began broadcasting his music live on a Memphis radio station called WDIA. At first, he used the name The Peptikon Boy on air, which later was changed to The Beale Street Blues Boy, and then further shortened to just Blues Boy or B.B.      King’s first hit on the R&B charts was “Three o’Clock in the Morning” in 1951. He first found success outside the blues market with the 1968 remake of the [Roy Hawkins](http://www.last.fm/music/Roy+Hawkins) tune, “The Thrill Is Gone”, which became a hit on both pop and R&B charts, a rare feat. King’s mainstream success continued throughout the 1970s with songs like “[To Know You Is To Love You](http://www.last.fm/music/B.B.+King/_/To+Know+You+Is+To+Love+You)” and “[I Like To Live The Love](http://www.last.fm/music/B.B.+King/_/I+Like+To+Live+The+Love)”. From 1951 to 1985, King appeared on Billboard’s R&B charts seventy-four times.      King continues to record to this day, recording both compilations of classic songs with other top artists, and new collaborative material with artists like [Eric Clapton](http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton).      Further facts:   Early life      King was born in a cabin on a cotton plantation outside of Berclair, Mississippi, to Albert King and Nora Ella Farr on September 16, 1925. In 1930, his father left the family, and his mother married another man. King was raised by his maternal grandmother Elnora Farr in Kilmichael, Mississippi.[8]   As a kid, King sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. It seems that at the age of 12, he purchased his first guitar for $15.00,[8] although another source indicates he was given his first guitar by Bukka White, his mother’s first cousin (King’s grandmother and White’s mother were sisters).[9] In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John’s Quartet of Inverness, Mississippi, performing at area churches and on WGRM in Greenwood, Mississippi.   In 1946, King followed Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months. However, King shortly returned to Mississippi, where he decided to prepare himself better for the next visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson’s radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King’s appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King’s Spot became so popular, it was expanded and became the Sepia Swing Club",2942089,blues,"['album rock', 'blues-rock', 'classic rock', 'electric blues', 'mellow gold', 'rock', 'soft rock']",b.b. king,75,"['Riding With The King', 'The Thrill Is Gone', 'The Thrill Is Gone', 'Hummingbird', 'Flesh & Bone (Dedicated to B.B.

"She was born in South Charleston, West Virginia because it had the nearest hospital to her parents’ home in Cross Lanes, where she grew up, graduating from nearby Nitro High School. In 1976, while in college, she joined the bluegrass band Pennsboro, and two years later dropped out of school to move to Nashville. She worked as a tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame, did backup vocal work for Bobby Goldsboro , and sang demos for several Nashville songwriters and publishers including Nashville songwriter/producer Byron Hill, who brought her to the attention of Frank Jones (then head of Mercury Records), who signed her to her first record deal in 1983.   Mattea’s third album, 1986’s folky Walk the Way the Wind Blows, proved to be her breakthrough both critically and commercially. Her cover of Nanci Griffith’s “Love at the Five and Dime” was her first major hit, reaching #3 (and in addition, earned Griffith notice as a songwriter); and the album produced three other top ten songs: “Walk the Way the Wind Blows” (#10), “You’re the Power (#5), and “Train of Memories” (#6).   Further hit songs include her first #1, “Goin’ Gone”; the truck-driving song “Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses” (1988); “Come From the Heart” and “Burnin’ Old Memories” (both #1 hits in 1989); “She Came From Fort Worth” (1990); “Lonesome Standard Time” (1992); “Walking Away a Winner” (1994); “Nobody’s Gonna Rain on Our Parade” (1994); “Maybe She’s Human” (1994); and “455 Rocket” (1997). “Eighteen Wheels,” in late May 1988, became the first single by a solo female to spend multiple weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard country singles chart since Dolly Parton’s “You’re the Only One” in August 1979; both singles were on top of that chart for two weeks.   The heart-wrenching “Where’ve You Been,” which Mattea’s husband Jon Vezner co- wrote with singer/songwriter Don Henry, reached #2 on the country chart and won her a 1990 Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal. Mattea is a repeat winner of the County Music Associations Female Vocalist of the Year, which she won on the success of “Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses” and “Where’ve You Been.”   The following year, Mattea took part in Voices That Care, a multi-artist project that featured other top names in music for a one-off single to raise money for the allied troops in the Gulf War. The project included fellow country singers Garth Brooks, Kenny Rogers and Randy Travis. She has also been heavily involved in HIV/AIDS-related charities beginning in the early 1990s, and is often credited with leading the country music community, commonly regarded as the last segment of the entertainment industry to address the AIDS epidemic, to finally do so. She performed with Mary Chapin Carpenter on VH1’s very first Save The Music concert, which also starred Bette Midler.

"Sarah Lois Vaughan (nicknamed “Sassy” and “The Divine One”) (March 27, 1924, Newark, New Jersey – April 3, 1990, Los Angeles, California) was an American [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) [singer](http://www.last.fm/tag/singer), described as “possessor of one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century”. Jazz critic Leonard Feather called her “the most important singer to emerge from the [bop](http://www.last.fm/tag/bop) era.” [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald) called her the world’s “greatest singing talent.” When introduced in her two-part interview of 1980 on The Dick Cavett Show, Cavett quipped (in a takeoff on a well known Sarah Lee product advertising slogan of the time), “Everybody doesn’t like something, but nobody doesn’t like Sarah Vaughn.” During the course of a career that spanned nearly fifty years, she was the singer’s singer, influencing everyone from [Mel Torme](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mel+Torme) to [Anita Baker](http://www.last.fm/music/Anita+Baker). She was among the musical elite identified by their first names. She was Sarah, Sassy — the incomparable Sarah Vaughan.      Sarah Vaughan’s father, Asbury “Jake” Vaughan, was a carpenter and amateur guitarist. Her mother, Ada, was a laundress. Jake and Ada Vaughan migrated to Newark from Virginia during the First World War. Sarah was their only natural child, although in the 1960s they adopted Donna, the child of a woman who traveled on the road with Sarah Vaughan. The Vaughans lived in a house on Newark’s Brunswick street for Sarah’s entire childhood. Jake Vaughan was deeply religious and the family was very active in the New Mount Zion Baptist Church on 186 Thomas Street. Sarah began piano lessons at the age of seven, sang in the church choir and occasionally played piano for rehearsals and service. Vaughan developed an early love for popular music on records and the radio. In the 1930s, Newark had a very active live music scene and Vaughan frequently saw local and touring bands that played in the city. Vaughan initially attended Newark’s East Side High School, later transferring to Newark Arts High School, which had opened in 1931 as the United States’ first arts “magnet” high school.[2] However, her nocturnal adventures as a performer began to overwhelm her academic pursuits and Vaughan dropped out of high school during her junior year to concentrate more fully on music. Around this time, Vaughan and her friends also began venturing across the Hudson River into New York City to hear big bands at Harlem’s Ballroom and Apollo Theater. Vaughan was frequently accompanied by a friend, Doris Robinson, on her trips into New York City. Sometime in the Fall of 1942 (when Sarah was 18 years old), Vaughan suggested that Robinson enter the Apollo Amateur Night contest. Vaughan played piano accompaniment for Robinson, who won second prize. Vaughan later decided to go back and compete herself as a singer",353674,jazz,"['adult standards', 'bebop', 'bossa nova', 'cool jazz', 'jazz', 'lounge', 'soul', 'swing', 'vocal jazz']",sarah vaughan,55,"['Black Coffee', 'Tenderly', 'Misty', 'Mean to Me', 'Make Yourself Comfortable', 'Lullaby Of Birdland', 'Broken Hearted Melody', 'Jump for Joy - 2007 Remaster', 'Whatever Lola Wants - Gotan Project Remix', ""He's My Guy""]"
"Tampa Red (January 8, 1904 - March 19, 1981), born Hudson Woodbridge but known from childhood as Hudson Whittaker, was an influential American musician.      Tampa Red is best known as an accomplished and influential blues guitarist who had a unique single-string bottleneck style. His songwriting and his silky, polished slide technique influenced other leading Chicago blues guitarists, such as Big Bill Broonzy and Robert Nighthawk, as well as Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Mose Allison and many others. In a career spanning over 30 years he also recorded pop, R&B and hokum records.      He was born Hudson Woodbridge in Smithville, Georgia. His parents died when he was a child, and he moved to Tampa, Florida, where he was raised by his aunt and grandmother and adopted their surname, Whittaker. He emulated his older brother, Eddie, who played guitar, and he was especially inspired by an old street musician called Piccolo Pete, who first taught him to play blues licks on a guitar.      In the 1920s, having already perfected his slide technique, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, and began his career as a musician, adopting the name “Tampa Red” from his childhood home and red hair. His big break was being hired to accompany Ma Rainey and he began recording in 1928 with “It’s Tight Like That”, in a bawdy and humorous style that became known as “hokum”. Early recordings were mostly collaborations with Thomas A. Dorsey, known at the time as Georgia Tom. Tampa Red and Georgia Tom recorded almost 90 sides, sometimes as “The Hokum Boys” or, with Frankie Jaxon, as “Tampa Red’s Hokum Jug Band”.      In 1928, Tampa Red became the first black musician to play a National steel- bodied resonator guitar, the loudest and showiest guitar available before amplification, acquiring one in the first year they were available. This allowed him to develop his trademark bottleneck style, playing single string runs, not block chords, which was a precursor to later blues and rock guitar soloing. The National guitar he used was a gold-plated tricone, which was found in Illinois in the 1990s and later sold to the “Experience Music Project” in Seattle. Tampa Red was known as “The Man With The Gold Guitar”, and, into the 1930s, he was billed as “The Guitar Wizard”.      His partnership with Dorsey ended in 1932, but he remained much in demand as a session musician, working with John Lee “Sonny Boy” Williamson, Memphis Minnie, and many others. In 1934 he signed for Victor Records. He formed the Chicago Five, a group of session musicians who created what became known as the Bluebird sound, a precursor of the small group style of later jump blues and rock and roll bands. He was a close friend and associate of Big Bill Broonzy and Big Maceo Merriweather",6570,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'boogie-woogie', 'chicago blues', 'country blues', 'traditional blues']",tampa red,33,"['Anna Lou Blues', 'Anna Lou Blues', 'You Missed a Good Man', 'Blue And Evil Blues - Remastered - 1997', 'Born to Be No Good', 'Mean And Evil Blues', 'Red Devil (Live)', ""You Can't Get That Stuff No More"", 'Let Me Play With Your Poodle', ""It's Tight Like That""]"

"John Smith Hurt, better known as Mississippi John Hurt (July 3, 1893 or March 8, 1892 - November 2, 1966) was an American country blues singer and guitarist.      Raised in Avalon, Mississippi, Hurt taught himself how to play the guitar around age nine. Singing to a melodious finger-picked accompaniment, he began to play local dances and parties while working as a sharecropper. He first recorded for Okeh Records in 1928, but these were commercial failures. Hurt then drifted out of the recording scene, and he continued his work as a farmer. Tom Hoskins, a blues enthusiast, would be the first to locate Hurt in 1963. He convinced Hurt to relocate to Washington, D.C., where he was recorded by the Library of Congress in 1964. This rediscovery helped further the American folk music revival, which had led to the rediscovery of many other bluesmen of Hurt’s era. Hurt entered the same university and coffeehouse concert circuit as his contemporaries, as well as other Delta blues musicians brought out of retirement. As well as playing concerts, he recorded several studio albums for Vanguard Records.      Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi (there is confusion about his date of birth, but the grave marker mentions March 8, 1892) and raised in Avalon, Mississippi, he learned to play guitar at age nine. He was completely self-taught, stealthily playing the guitar of a friend of his mother’s, who often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a lady who lived near by. His style was not reminiscent of any other style being played at the time; it was the way Hurt “thought the guitar should sound”. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances, earning a living as a farmhand into the 1920s. His fast, highly syncopated style of playing made his music adept for dancing. On occasion, a medicine show would come through the area; Hurt recalls being wanted by one of them. “One of them wanted me, but I said no because I just never wanted to get away from home.” In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith.      When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest, he recommended Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning “Monday Morning Blues” at his home, he took part in two recording sessions, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). While in Memphis, Hurt recalled seeing “many, many blues singers … Lonnie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and lots, lots more.” Hurt described his first recording session as such:   … a great big hall with only the three of us in it: me, the man [Rockwell], and the engineer. It was really something. I sat on a chair, and they pushed the microphone right up to my mouth and told me that I couldn’t move after they had found the right position.

Since the release of the band’s debut album, _[Parachutes](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Parachutes)_ (2000), Coldplay has also drawn influence from other sources, including [Echo And The Bunnymen](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Echo+And+The+Bunnymen) and [George Harrison](http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison) on _[A Rush of Blood to the Head](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/A+Rush+of+Blood+to+the+Head)_ (2002) and [Johnny Cash](http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash) and [Kraftwerk](http://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk) for _[X&Y](http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/X&Y)_ (2005).      Frontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band [a-ha](http://www.last.fm/music/a-ha) for inspiring him to form his own band.      Coldplay never intended to become England’s favorite rock & roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of [Bob Dylan](http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan), [The Stone Roses](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses), [Neil Young](http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young), and [My Bloody Valentine](http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine).

"Dino Paul Crocetti (born June 7, 1917 in Steubenville, Ohio; died December 25, 1995 in Beverly Hills, California), better known as Dean Martin and often referred to as the King of Cool, was an Italian American singer, actor, comedian and member of [The Rat Pack](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rat+Pack) who was signed to [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra)’s Reprise Records. Despite the fact that Martin couldn’t read music, he recorded more than 100 albums over his career, racking up major hits such as That’s Amore, Volare and his signature tune Everybody Loves Somebody. He was also a successful film actor and won a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Who Was That Lady?.      Born Dino Paul Crocetti in Steubenville, Ohio to Italian immigrant parents, Gaetano and Angela Crocetti (née Barra). His father was an immigrant from Abruzzo, Italy, and his mother was an Italian of part Neapolitan and part Sicilian ancestry. Martin was the younger of two sons. His brother was called Bill. Martin spoke only Italian until he started school at the age of five. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, Ohio and took up the drums as a hobby as a teenager. He was the target of much ridicule for his broken English and ultimately dropped out from Steubenville High School in the 10th grade because he thought that he was smarter than his teachers. He delivered bootleg liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, wrote crafty anecdotes, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill and boxed as welterweight. He grew up a neighbor to Jimmy the Greek.      At the age of 15, he was a boxer who billed himself as “Kid Crochet”. His prizefighting years earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, and many sets of broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford the tape used to wrap boxers’ hands). Of his twelve bouts, he would later say “I won all but eleven.” For a time, he roomed with Sonny King, who, like Martin, was just starting in show business and had little money. It is said that Martin and King held bare-knuckle matches in their apartment, fighting until one of them was knocked out; people paid to watch.      Eventually, Martin gave up boxing. He worked as a roulette stickman and croupier in an illegal casino behind a tobacco shop where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time, he sang with local bands. Calling himself “Dino Martini” (after the then-famous Metropolitan Opera tenor, Nino Martini), he got his first break working for the Ernie McKay Orchestra. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills (of the Mills Brothers), among others. In the early 1940s, he started singing for bandleader Sammy Watkins, who suggested he change his name to Dean Martin.      In October 1941, Martin married Elizabeth Anne McDonald. During their marriage (ended by divorce in 1949), they had four children",728385,,"['adult standards', 'easy listening', 'lounge', 'vocal jazz']",dean martin,68,"[""That's Amore"", 'Volare (Nel Blu Di Pinto Di Blu) - Remastered', ""Ain't That A Kick In The Head"", 'Everybody Loves Somebody', ""You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You - Remastered/1997"", 'Sway (Quien Sera)', 'Everybody Loves Somebody', ""Ain't That A Kick In The Head - Remastered"", 'Mambo Italiano', ""On An Evening In Roma (Sott'er Celo De Roma) - Remastered""]"
"Marilyn Monroe, (1 June 1926 – 5 August 1962), born Norma Jeane Mortenson but baptized Norma Jeane Baker, was an American actress, singer and model. She was born in Los Angeles, California, U.S.      After spending much of her childhood in foster homes, Monroe began a career as a model, which led to a film contract in 1947. Her early roles were minor, but her performances in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve (both 1950) were well received. She was praised for her comedic ability in such films as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire and The Seven Year Itch, and became one of Hollywood’s most popular and glamorous performers.      The typecasting of Monroe’s “dumb blonde” persona limited her career prospects, so she broadened her range. She studied at the Actors Studio and formed Marilyn Monroe Productions. Her dramatic performance in William Inge’s Bus Stop was hailed by critics, and she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in Some Like it Hot.      The final years of Monroe’s life were marked by illness, personal problems, and a reputation for being unreliable and difficult to work with. The circumstances of her death, from an overdose of barbiturates, have been the subject of conjecture. Though officially classified as a “probable suicide”, the possibility of an accidental overdose has not been ruled out, while conspiracy theorists argue that she was murdered.      In 1999, Monroe was ranked as the sixth greatest female star of all time by the American Film Institute.      Marilyn’s personal life started at a young age at age of 16 when she firstly married James Dougherty on August 5, 1942 in Brentwood, California.Marilyn had affairs with actor Clark Gable from late December 1942 to late January 1943.      She had 2 children from her marriage, Robert (June 19, 1943) and Shirley (January 14, 1945).She divorced Dougherty on May 19, 1946.Her eldest son Robert almost went through his mother’s childhood life and was almost fostered.      After Monroe made How To Marry A Millionaire(1953) in 1953, her 10 year-old son started show-business.She met Joe DiMaggio on December 30, 1954 at nightclub in Vegas.They married on January 14, 1954 in Las Vegas, Nevada.      She alleged that DiMaggio raped her on her wedding night.They divorced on August 4, 1954 in Las Vegas, Nevada.      Monroe married Arthur Miller on June 4, 1956 in Phoenix, Nevada.They moved to Brentwood, California in early August 1956.Monroe and Miller had 2 children, Janice (May 19, 1957) and Margo (November 17, 1958).      The couple divorced on November 12, 1961 in Los Angeles, California.She was found dead at her home in Brentwood, California after a barbiturate(sleeping pill)overdose on August 5, 1962 when she was age 36.

"Soul Asylum is an [american](http://www.last.fm/tag/american) [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) band formed in the summer of 1981 by Minneapolis high school friends Dan Murphy, Karl Mueller, and [Dave Pirner](http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Pirner). The band (named [Loud Fast Rules](http://www.last.fm/music/Loud+Fast+Rules) up until 1984) quickly became frontrunners of American college rock, following in the tradition of fellow Minnesota bands [Hüsker Dü](http://www.last.fm/music/H%C3%BCsker+D%C3%BC) and [The Replacements](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Replacements).      Landing their first record deal with Twin/Tone in 1984, Soul Asylum recorded a total of four albums for the local label: Say What You Will… Everything Can Happen in 1984 (later reissued as [Say What You Will, Clarence… Karl Sold the  Truck](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Say+What+You+Will,+Clarence...+Kar l+Sold+the+Truck)), [Made to Be Broken](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Made+to+Be+Broken) in 1986, [While You Were Out](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/While+You+Were+Out) in 1986, and the EP [Clam Dip And Other Delights](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Clam+Dip+And+Other+Delights) in 1988. The band then switched to A&M, releasing [Hang Time](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Hang+Time) in 1988 and [And The Horse They Rode In On](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/And+The+Horse+They+Rode+In+On) in 1990 under that label. Although they enjoyed some success as a live band, Soul Asylum suffered from low album sales and considered disbanding.      In 1992, they signed with Columbia Records to produce [Grave Dancers Union](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Grave+Dancers+Union), a record that would come to transform them from underground college rockers to international superstars. The first two singles off the album, [Somebody to Shove](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Somebody+to+Shove) and [Black Gold](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Black+Gold), both came in at high positions at the Modern Rock and Album Rock charts, but it was the album’s third track and it’s video of missing teens that led them to their major breakthrough. [Runaway Train](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Runaway+Train) peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, raised album sales to double-platinum level, and won Soul Asylum the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 1994.      In 1995, Soul Asylum followed up the success of Grave Dancers Union with [Let Your Dim Light Shine](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Let+Your+Dim+Light+Shine), which climbed to #6 on the Billboard 200 and featured the #1 Modern Rock track [Misery](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/_/Misery). After releasing [Candy From A Stranger](http://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Asylum/Candy+From+A+Stranger) in 1998, the band members took a break from recording and didn’t release a new studio album for the better part of seven years.

The Beastie Boys were the first successful white rap group and one of the few acts from the early days of hip-hop that still enjoyed major success their whole career Their rock and punk-influenced rap has had a significant impact on artists both in and outside the hip-hop scene, and they were the first rap group to gain a substantial following with [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) fans.      The Beastie Boys came together in 1979 as a punk band called The Young Aboriginies. In 1981 MCA joined the group and from the suggestion of their guitarist John Berry, they changed their name to Beastie Boys.

"Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup (also known as “Pop” Crudup) (August 24, 1905 – March 28, 1976) was a [delta blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/delta%20blues) singer and guitarist. He is best known outside blues circles for writing songs later covered by [Elvis Presley](http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley) (and since covered by dozens of other artists), such as “That’s All Right Mama”, “My Baby Left Me” and “So glad you’re mine”, and by many claims, “Blue Suede Shoes”.      Born in Forest, Mississippi and living and working in throughout the South and Midwest as a migrant worker for a time, he and his family returned to Mississippi in 1926. He sang [gospel](http://www.last.fm/tag/gospel), then began his career as a [blues](http://www.last.fm/tag/blues) singer around Clarksdale, Mississippi. He visited Chicago as member of the Harmonizing Four in 1939 and stayed there to work as a solo musician, but barely made a living as a street singer. Record producer Lester Melrose allegedly found him while he was living in a packing crate, introduced him to Tampa Red and signed him to a contract with RCA Victor’s Bluebird label.      He recorded with RCA in the late 1940s and with Ace Records, Checker Records and Trumpet Records in the early 1950s and toured throughout the country, specifically Black establishments in the South, with [Sonny Boy Williamson II](http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Boy+Williamson+II) and [Elmore James](http://www.last.fm/music/Elmore+James). He also recorded under the names [Elmer James](http://www.last.fm/music/Elmer+James) and [Percy Lee Crudup](http://www.last.fm/music/Percy+Lee+Crudup).      Crudup stopped recording in the 1950s, however, after further battles over royalties. He returned to recording with [Fire Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Fire+Records) and [Delmark Records](http://www.last.fm/label/Delmark+Records) and touring in the 1960s, sometimes labeled “The Father of Rock and Roll”, a title which he accepted with some bemusement. Throughout this time Crudup worked as a laborer to augment the small wages he received as a singer and non-existent royalties. Crudup returned to Mississippi after a dispute with Melrose over royalties, then went into bootlegging, and later moved to Virginia where he had lived and worked as a musician and laborer. In the early 1970’s, two local Virginia activists, Celia Santiago and Margaret Carter, both assisted him in attempting to gain Royalties he felt he were due, to little gain.      From the mid 60’s Crudup returned to bootlegging and working as an agricultural laborer, chiefly in Virginia, where he lived with his family including three sons and several of his own siblings. On the Eastern Shore of Virginia, while he lived in relative poverty as a field laborer, he occasionally sang and supplied moonshine to a number of drinking establishments, including one called the Dew Drop Inn, in Accomack County for some time prior to his eventual death, due to complications from heart disease and diabetes",11029,blues,"['acoustic blues', 'blues', 'chicago blues', 'delta blues', 'traditional blues']","arthur ""big boy"" crudup",34,"[""That's All Right"", ""My Mama Don't Allow Me"", 'Dig Myself A Hole', ""That's All Right"", ""I'm Gonna Dig Myself A Hole"", ""I'm Gonna Dig Myself A Hole"", 'My Baby Left Me - Remastered 2003', ""That's Alright"", ""So Glad You're Mine"", ""That's All Right""]"
"Thomas Francis “Tommy” Dorsey, Jr. (November 19, 1905 - November 26, 1956) was an American jazz trombonist, trumpeter, composer, and bandleader of the Big Band era. He was known as “The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing”, because of his smooth-toned trombone playing. Although he was not known for being a notable soloist, his technical skill on the trombone gave him renown amongst other musicians. He was the younger brother of bandleader [Jimmy Dorsey](http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Dorsey). After Dorsey broke with his brother in the mid-1930s, he led an extremely popular and highly successful band from the late 1930s into the 1950s, the [Tommy Dorsey Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Dorsey+Orchestra).      Thomas Francis Dorsey, Jr., was born in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, the second of four children born to Thomas Francis Dorsey, Sr., and Theresa (née Langton) Dorsey. He and Jimmy, his older brother by slightly less than two years, would become famous as the “Dorsey Brothers”. The two younger siblings were Mary and Edward (who died young). Tommy Dorsey initially studied the trumpet with his father, only to later switch to the trombone.   His Father, Thomas F. Dorsey, Sr. died July 13, 1942. Thomas Sr was born in Shenandoah, PA and was a bandleader himself.   At age 15, Jimmy recommended Tommy as the replacement for Russ Morgan in the 1920s territory band “The Scranton Sirens.” Tommy and Jimmy worked in several bands, including those of Tal Henry, Rudy Vallee, Vincent Lopez, Nathaniel Shilkret. In 1923, Dorsey followed his brother Jimmy to Detroit to play in Jean Goldkette’s band and later returned to New York in 1925 to play with the California Ramblers. In 1927 he joined Paul Whiteman. In 1929, the Dorsey Brothers had their first hit with “Coquette” for OKeh records.   In 1934, the Dorsey Brothers band signed with Decca records, having a hit with “I Believe In Miracles”. Future bandleader Glenn Miller was a member of [The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Dorsey+Brothers+Orchestra) in 1934 and 1935, composing “Annie’s Cousin Fanny”, “Tomorrow’s Another Day”, “Harlem Chapel Chimes”, and “Dese Dem Dose”, all recorded for Decca, for the band. Ongoing acrimony between the brothers, however, led to Tommy Dorsey’s walking out to form his own band in 1935, just as the orchestra was having a hit with “Every Little Moment.” Dorsey’s orchestra was known primarily for its renderings of ballads at dance tempos, frequently with singers such as [Jack Leonard](http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Leonard) and [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra).      Tommy Dorsey’s first band was formed out of the remains of the Joe Haymes band, and so began Dorsey’s long-running practice of raiding other bands for talent. If he admired a vocalist, musician, or arranger, he would think nothing of taking over their contracts and careers.

"It has always been about the songs. SHeDAISY’s place in the music world begins with Kristyn Osborn’s songwriting, with her ability to probe her psyche and, by extension, ours. The fact that she and sisters Kelsi and Kassidy are equally adept at placing those songs in intriguing and memorable settings, at making them come alive in the studio and on stage, is the rest of the multi- platinum equation.      As their winding career path makes clear, though, nothing important is ever established or sustained without struggle and re-evaluation, without the willingness to adjust course now and then. Theirs has been a journey for which they have drawn strength from both success and misadventure, turning missteps into lessons and challenge into triumph. The result is a hard-won artistic maturity, and the CD that embodies the latest phase of their journey, Fortuneteller’s Melody, represents a liberating step forward.      The process began, as always, with Kristyn’s songwriting. As Kelsi and Kassidy took to the road for a radio tour accompanying the release of Sweet Right Here, a rebound record which went gold and gave the trio renewed momentum, Kristyn spent more than three months turning the stuff of life into art with the help of collaborators that included Don Schlitz and Sheryl Crow.      From there, though, everything was new. The trio chose to work with Grammy producer of the year and another Kristyn songwriting collaborator, John Shanks, known for his work with Melissa Etheridge, Keith Urban, Kelly Clarkson, Alanis Morissette, Bon Jovi and many others. In working with him, they re-invented the way they make records: instead of the meticulous planning that went into earlier efforts, they worked almost off-the-cuff.      “We would walk into the studio this time not knowing the song,” says Kristyn. “John and I would be finishing one in the other room then we’d go straight in and record it. Kassidy might learn it as I was finishing the lyric. We were allowing the songs themselves to take control, rather than our arrangements of the song.”      “It freaked me out because I love to be prepared,” says Kassidy. “With the other records, we would arrange songs for a month and then go into the studio totally ready, but I surprised myself this time. There’s freedom in this approach, and there’s something great and fresh about that.”      The result was a recording process that echoed the approach of songwriting.      “It forces you to draw from a place that’s beyond the surface,” says Kristyn. “You find things in yourself that you didn’t know were there. For Kassidy, it’s her voice. ‘Where are those licks going to come from?’ ‘Where is the soul going to come from in the music?’ John just made us find it.”      What held it all together was the consistency of voice in Kristyn’s writing, the nuanced look at life, love and redemption that made up the project’s songs.      “This is about relationships,” she says",168059,soul,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country dawn', 'country road']",shedaisy,39,"['Little Good-Byes', ""Don't Worry 'Bout A Thing"", 'Come Home Soon', 'I Will...

"**William “Count” Basie** (August 21, 1904– April 26, 1984) was a [jazz](http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz) pianist, organist, composer, and bandleader.      As a pianist, he had a distinctive and influential style (the song title “Splanky” is an onomatopoetic reference to the sound of his playing), equally at home in the barrelhouse and the concert hall. Willie “The Lion” Smith, James P. Johnson, and Fats Waller were among his influences.      As a bandleader, he created an organization (built upon the remains of [Bennie Moten](http://www.last.fm/music/Bennie+Moten)’s Kansas City Orchestra) that was a favorite both of dancers and of vocalists such as [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra), [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald), [Sarah Vaughan](http://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Vaughan), and, of course, [Billie Holiday](http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday). Equally important, it kept many musicians employed through lean years. Many jazz musicians of note built their chops and earned their bread and butter in Basie’s organization.      In addition to Basie, the swinging “All American Rhythm Section” of his orchestra included greats such as Walter Page (bass), Jo Jones (drums), and Freddie Green (guitar). It was the greatest, most swinging rhythm sections in the history of jazz. Chief among its vocalists were, first, Jimmy Rushing and, later, Joe Williams. Over the years it boasted sidemen and soloists like Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Lester Young (tenor sax), Eddie “Lockjaw” Davis (tenor sax), Buddy Tate (tenor sax), Illinois Jacquet (tenor sax), Earle Warren (alto sax), Jack Washington (alto & baritone sax), Harry “Sweets” Edison (trumpet), Buck Clayton (trumpet), Thad Jones (trumpet), Snooky Young (trumpet), Benny Morton (trombone), Benny Powell (trombone), and Dicky Wells (trombone).      Basie also collaborated with artists such as Zoot Sims and Oscar Peterson, and recorded with ensembles large and small, including the Count Basie Trio, the Count Basie Sextet, and the Kansas City Seven. Notable arrangers included Eddie Durham (who helped shape the Basie Orchestra’s sound) and Neal Hefti.

"Bobby Vee (born April 30, 1943) is an American pop music singer. Born Robert Thomas Velline in Fargo, North Dakota, United States, his 1961 summer release Take Good Care Of My Baby went to No.1 on the Billboard U.S. and number 3 on the UK singles chart (according to EveryHit.com). Known primarily as a performer of Brill Building pop material, he went on to record a string of international hits in the 1960s, including Devil or Angel, Rubber Ball (1961), More Than I Can Say (1961), Run To Him (1961), The Night Has A Thousand Eyes (1963), and Come Back When You Grow Up. When Vee recorded Come Back When You Grow Up in 1967, he was joined by a band called “‘The Strangers’”.      His first single was Suzie Baby, an original song penned by Vee which nodded towards Holly’s Peggy Sue for the Minneapolis-based Soma Records in 1959; it drew enough attention and chart action to be purchased by Liberty Records, which signed him to their label in early 1960. His followup single, a cover of Adam Faith’s UK Number 1 What Do You Want? charted in the lower reaches of Billboard in early 1960; however, it was his fourth recording, a revival of The Clovers’ doo-wop ballad Devil or Angel, that brought him into the big time with US buyers. His follow-up single, Rubber Ball, was the record that made him an international star.   Vee was also a pioneer in the music video genre, appearing in several musical motion pictures as well as in the Scopitone series of early film-and-music jukebox recordings. He is a 1999 inductee of the North Dakota Roughrider Award.      Vee’s career began amid tragedy. On “The Day the Music Died” (3 February 1959), the three headline acts in the lineup of the traveling “Winter Dance Party”, Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and J.P. “The Big Bopper” Richardson, were killed in the crash of aircraft N3974N near Clear Lake, Iowa while en route to the next show on the tour itenerary in Moorhead, Minnesota. Velline, then aged 15, and a hastily-assembled band of Fargo, North Dakota schoolboys calling themselves Bobby Vee and the Shadows volunteered for and were given the unenviable job of filling in for Holly and his band The Crickets at the Moorhead engagement. Their performance there was a success, setting in motion a chain of events that led to Vee’s career as a popular singer.   Despite the circumstances of his debut, Vee went on to become a bona fide star, and regularly performs at the Winter Dance Party memorial concerts in Clear Lake to this day.

"Filter (stylized as FILTER) is an [alternative rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock) group formed in 1993 in Cleveland, Ohio by Richard Patrick and guitarist/programmer Brian Liesegang, who later left the band in 1997 to form [Ashtar Command](http://www.last.fm/music/Ashtar+Command) with Chris Holmes. Filter has released five studio albums      Their first album, _[Short Bus](http://www.last.fm/music/Filter/Short+Bus)_, was released in 1995. The album was commercially successful, and included the hit single “Hey Man, Nice Shot”. The song was somewhat controversial, as it was seen as capitalizing on the public suicide of Budd Dwyer. [Kurt Cobain](http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain)’s suicide was widely rumored to have inspired the song, but the band refuted this. In need of a live band to tour the album, Patrick and Liesegang recruited Geno Lenardo on guitar, Frank Cavanagh on bass, and Matt Walker on drums. They would all later be featured in the video for the album’s second single, “Dose”.      Between Filter’s first and second albums, the band became known for their soundtrack contributions, The first of these tracks, “Thanks Bro”, landed on the _Songs In The Key Of X: Music From And Inspired By The X-Files_ album. In 1996, Filter recorded and filmed the video for the song “Jurassitol”, for _The Crow: City of Angels_ soundtrack. They also released the home video Phenomenology in 1996, which showcased some of the band’s live performances and music videos, as well as an interview with Patrick and Liesegang filmed in New Mexico.      Liesegang left in 1997 shortly after recording the Filter/The Crystal Method collaboration “(Can’t You) Trip Like I Do” for the _Spawn_ movie soundtrack, due to creative differences with Patrick. In 1998, for the _X-Files_ film soundtrack, Patrick decided to keep the Filter name and recorded a cover of [Harry Nilsson](http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Nilsson)’s “One”.      Patrick continued with 1999’s _[Title of Record](http://www.last.fm/music/Filter/Title+of+Record)_ with returning members Lenardo and Cavanagh, as well as Steve Gillis on drums, filling in the gap left by Walker after he left to work with [The Smashing Pumpkins](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smashing+Pumpkins). _Title of Record_ moved away from [industrial rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/industrial%20rock) somewhat, and resulted in the band’s biggest hit, the mellow ballad “Take a Picture”, along with other lesser-heard singles “Welcome to the Fold” and “The Best Things”. The song “Take a Picture” is about a dispute on an aircraft, when Richard Patrick drunkenly stripped down to his boxers, alarming the other passengers.      The song “Captain Bligh” (after Vice-Admiral William Bligh of the HMS Bounty) was written by Patrick after leaving [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails) and was about [Trent Reznor](http://www.last.fm/music/Trent+Reznor)’s notoriously anti-social habits",231756,soundtrack,"['alternative metal', 'alternative rock', 'grunge', 'industrial metal', 'industrial rock', 'nu metal', 'pop rock', 'post-grunge', 'rap rock', 'rock']",filter,58,"['Hey Man Nice Shot', 'Take a Picture', 'Band Plays On', 'No Filter', 'One of Them Days (feat.

"Soundgarden is a Seattle rock band who helped to define the sound that came to be called [grunge](http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge). Despite starting years earlier, and having a sound that more closely resembled [Black Sabbath](http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath) or [Led Zeppelin](http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin) than their contemporaries, they are considered one of the “big four” of the ’90s Seattle grunge bands, along with [Alice in Chains](http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains), [Nirvana](http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana) and [Pearl Jam](http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam).      The band was formed in 1984 by [Chris Cornell](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Cornell) (vocals, and originally drums) and Hiro Yamamoto (bass), to be joined later by [Kim Thayil](http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Thayil) (guitar) and Scott Sundquist (drums). Thayil joined the band after moving to Seattle from [illinois](http://www.last.fm/tag/illinois) with Yamamoto and Bruce Pavitt, who would later start [sub pop records](http://www.last.fm/tag/sub%20pop%20records). Scott Sundquist, who left in 1986 to concentrate more on his family, was replaced on drums by [Matt Cameron](http://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Cameron).

"Ray Charles (Ray Charles Robinson, Albany, Georgia, September 23, 1930 - Beverly Hills, California, June 10, 2004), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, arranger, and band leader.      As a rock and roll, rhythm & blues, soul, blues, jazz, country and pop musician he helped to shape the sound of rhythm & blues.      He brought a soulful sound to everything from country music (“[I Can’t Stop Loving You](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/_/I+Can%27t+Stop+Loving+You)”) to rock and roll (“[Mess Around](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/_/Mess+Around)”), to pop standards to a now-iconic rendition of “[America The Beautiful](http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/_/America+The+Beautiful).” [Frank Sinatra](http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra) called him “the only genius in the business.”      Ray Charles was born in Albany, Georgia on September 23, 1930. He was the son of Aretha Williams, a share cropper, and Bailey Robinson, a railroad repair man, mechanic and handyman. The two were never married. The family moved to Greenville, Florida, when Ray was an infant. Bailey had three more families, leaving Aretha to raise the family on her own.      Ray Charles was not born blind. He started to lose his sight somewhere at the age of five. He was rendered totally blind by the age of seven. Charles never knew exactly why he lost his sight, though there are sources that suggest his blindness was due to glaucoma, and some other sources suggest that Ray began to lose his sight from an infection caused by soapy water to his eyes which was left untreated. He attended school at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine, Florida from 1937-1945 where he developed his musical gift that he is known and remembered for today. His father died when he was ten, followed by his mother five years later.      In school, he was taught only classical music, but he wanted to play what he heard on the radio, jazz and blues. After his mother died, Charles did not return to school. He lived in Jacksonville with a couple who were friends of his mother. For over a year, he played the piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla, earning $4 a night. Charles moved to Orlando, then Tampa, where he played “with a hillbilly band called The Florida Playboys.” This is where Charles began his reputation of always wearing sunglasses that were made by designer Billy Stickles.      Charles had always played for other people, but he wanted a band that was his own. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, but Chicago and New York City were too big. He moved to Seattle in 1947 and soon started recording, first for the label Swing Time Records, achieving his first hit with the 1949 “Confession Blues”. The song soared to #2 on the R&B charts. He followed his first recording with his only other hit with Swingtime, “Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand” in 1951. It hit #5 on the R&B charts. He then signed with Ahmet Ertegün at Atlantic Records a year later",1423925,blues,"['adult standards', 'classic soul', 'jazz blues', 'piano blues', 'soul', 'soul blues', 'vocal jazz']",ray charles,68,"[""I've Got a Woman"", 'Seven Spanish Angels (with Ray Charles)', 'Seven Spanish Angels (With Ray Charles)', 'Hallelujah, I Love Her So', ""What'd I Say, Pt. 1 & 2"", 'Mess Around', 'America The Beautiful', 'Baby Grand (with Ray Charles)', 'Ray Charles', 'Here We Go Again']"
